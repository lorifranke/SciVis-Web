  ABSTRACT Scholarly information usually contains millions of raw data, such as authors, papers, citations,
  as well as scholarly networks. With the rapid growth of the digital publishing and harvesting, how to visually
  present the data efficiently becomes challenging. Nowadays, various visualization techniques can be easily
  applied on scholarly data visualization and visual analysis, which enables scientists to have a better way to
  represent the structure of scholarly data sets and reveal hidden patterns in the data. In this paper, we first
  introduce the basic concepts and the collection of scholarly data. Then, we provide a comprehensive overview
  of related data visualization tools, existing techniques, as well as systems for the analyzing volumes of diverse
  scholarly data. Finally, open issues are discussed to pursue new solutions for abundant and complicated
  scholarly data visualization, as well as techniques, that support a multitude of facets.


  INDEX TERMS Scholarly data, scholarly data analysis, scholarly data visualization, visual analysis.

divided into two typical ways: personal center network analy-

conditions of study in scholarly networks visualization from
following two aspects: visualization of scholarly ego-centric
network and visualization of scholarly sociocentric network.
