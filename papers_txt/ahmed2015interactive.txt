called G RAPH V IS (http://graphvis.com) that integrates pow-

   G RAPH V IS is a visual analytics tool for network data,
designed for rapid interactive visual exploration and graph
mining (Figure 1). Starting from a simple drag-and-drop
of a graph file into the browser, users can move from data
to insights within seconds. Unlike other network visual-
