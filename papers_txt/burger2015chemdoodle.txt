ChemDoodle Web Components: HTML5
toolkit for chemical graphics, interfaces,
and informatics
Melanie C Burger1,2*



  Abstract
  ChemDoodle Web Components (abbreviated CWC, iChemLabs, LLC) is a light-weight (~340 KB) JavaScript/HTML5
  toolkit for chemical graphics, structure editing, interfaces, and informatics based on the proprietary ChemDoodle
  desktop software. The library uses <canvas> and WebGL technologies and other HTML5 features to provide solutions
  for creating chemistry-related applications for the web on desktop and mobile platforms. CWC can serve a broad
  range of scientific disciplines including crystallography, materials science, organic and inorganic chemistry, biochem-
  istry and chemical biology. CWC is freely available for in-house use and is open source (GPL v3) for all other uses.
