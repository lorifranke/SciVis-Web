        Abstract
        The paper presents MeshLab, an open source, extensible, mesh processing system that has been developed at
        the Visual Computing Lab of the ISTI-CNR with the helps of tens of students. We will describe the MeshLab
        architecture, its main features and design objectives discussing what strategies have been used to support its
        development. Various examples of the practical uses of MeshLab in research and professional frameworks are
        reported to show the various capabilities of the presented system.

common models are often plagued by many different issues,
and inconsistencies both topological and geometrical. Typi-
cal example of topological issues are the presence of vertices
that are not referenced, or duplicated among faces, incon-
sistency in the face orientation, edge and vertex non mani-
foldness. For all of them meshlab provide tools for detect-
ing and in many cases removing them. Similarly there are
many geometrical issues that can arise frequently, like the
plain presence of self-intersecting faces, ghost geometry in-
side the object, small floating pieces around the mesh, badly
shaped triangles, fold-over and other high curvature config-
urations. Again MeshLab provide tools for detecting these
situations. In figure 8 two example of the visualization tools
