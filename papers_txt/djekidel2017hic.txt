       Background: Although signiﬁcant progress has been made to map chromatin structure at unprecedented resolution
       and scales, we are short of tools that enable the intuitive visualization and navigation along the three-dimensional (3D)
       structure of chromatins. The available tools people have so far are generally script-based or present basic features
       that do not easily enable the integration of genomic data along with 3D chromatin structure, hence, many scientists
       ﬁnd themselves in the obligation to hack tools designed for other purposes such as tools for protein structure
       study.
       Methods: We present HiC-3DViewer, a new browser-based interactive tool designed to provide an intuitive
       environment for investigators to facilitate the 3D exploratory analysis of Hi-C data along with many useful annotation
       functionalities. Among the key features of HiC-3DViewer relevant to chromatin conformation studies, the most
       important one is the 1D-to-2D-to-3D mapping, to highlight genomic regions of interest interactively. This feature
       enables investigators to explore their data at different levels/angels. Additionally, investigators can superpose
       different genomic signals (such as ChIP-Seq, SNP) on the top of the 3D structure.
       Results: As a proof of principle we applied HiC-3DViewer to investigate the quality of Hi-C data and to show the
       spatial binding of GATA1 and GATA2 along the genome.
       Conclusions: As a user-friendly tool, HiC-3DViewer enables the visualization of inter/intra-chromatin interactions
       and gives users the ﬂexibility to customize the look-and-feel of the 3D structure with a simple click. HiC-3DViewer is
       implemented in Javascript and Python, and is freely available at: http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/member/nadhir/
