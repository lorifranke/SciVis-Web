                                                fiber clusters in 2D and 3D. With FiberStars, researchers can analyze and compare multiple subjects in large collections of brain fibers.

the dimensionality reduction problem tends to be more user-friendly in
that it is robust and requires no fine-tuning of artefactual parameters.
In FiberStars, our method of choice is PivotMDS [9], as it satisfies the
above requirements and can efficiently scale to very large data sets.
    Mei et al. [35] use a related technique, Landmark MDS [17], to
compute projections for fibers within a cluster. However, Brandes and
Pich [10] show PivotMDS is superior to Landmark MDS in general
graph layouts, a closely related problem. For better readability of
individual data points in the already colorful space we further waive a
density map overlay as suggested in [35].
    Via the Universal Toolbar, the user can further map cluster scalar
or subject attribute values to points in the projection. Moreover, the
projection view hosts two action listeners (Fig. 2). 1 Upon hovering a
cluster point, a detailed pop-up summarizes statistics about the cluster,
its corresponding subject and also displays the abstract cluster represen-
tation in the form of a radar chart that is further described in the next
part of this section. 2 Via rectangular brushing, the user can choose
clusters of interest, which will then be added to the alternative views
across the application. Since we always display all selected clusters for     Fig. 3. Multi-Cluster view of five different subjects and three differ-

corresponding clusters in other subjects can be more quickly identified.
Thus, the distribution of these grouped clusters can be assessed directly
within a potentially crowded point cloud.

   Abstract Representation. We choose consistent coloring of
reappearing elements and information throughout FiberStars. For ex-
ample, the same subject and the same cluster are always highlighted in
the same color to avoid getting lost in the wealth of information. We im-
plement color consistency in all views of the application. Furthermore,
we leverage Pop-up elements that help the user to keep the orientation
across different views. In the projection view, we provide a Pop-Up
when hovering over a single cluster point, as seen in 1 in Figure 2,
leading to more details of the cluster and the region of interest.
