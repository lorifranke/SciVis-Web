   3.1.4 NeuroCave. NeuroCave is an open source web-based im-
mersive visual analytics tool, proposed by Johnson J.G. Keiriz[10],
for exploring the human connectome datasets. Brain researchers
can interact in different environments (standard desktop, portable
VR headsets). NeuroCave offers synchronized comparison of dif-
ferent connectomes (brain networks) and layouts. The tool enables
to perform the exploration of the intrinsic geometry of the brain,
users can switch quickly and explore all the regions of the brain,
with a easy interface to use, including stereoscopy for better depth
perception. NeuroCave provides new functionality to support a
range of analysis tasks not available in other visualization software
platforms.
   NeuroCave uses the force directed edge bundling (FDEB) algo-
rithm to group edges going in the same direction[8].Demos and
tests of the tool are available3 , as well as the source code4 .                                    Figure 7: Exemple of 4D scatter plot

   4.1.3 Method 3: “A-Frame and Node.js”. Node.js is a free soft-
ware and event platform in JavaScript oriented to network applica-
tions that must be able to scale. It uses the virtual machine V8 and
implements under the MIT license CommonJS specifications.
   Among the native modules of Node.js, there is http, which allows
the development of HTTP server. It is possible to do without web
servers such as Nginx or Apache when deploying sites and web
applications with Node.js.
   Concretely, Node.js is a low-level environment allowing the
execution of JavaScript on the server side. Node.js is becoming
more and more popular as a server platform, it is used by Groupon,
Vivaldi, SAP, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Yahoo !, Walmart, Rakuten, Sage
and PayPal.
   Node.js can be compared to Python, Ruby, Java, PHP. There is a
multitude of such comparisons in the web. Among the advantages
of Node.js we highlight:
    (1)   Free software (MIT license).
    (2)   No-blocking model.
    (3)   Very active community.
    (4)   Integrated package system (NPM).
    (5)   Large companies use it.
    The most important advantage of this method is that it allows
synchronous or real-time communication in our application, using
its socket.io library, which helps us to use Websockets easily. The
socket.io library is based on several synchronous communication
techniques such as WebSocket, Ajax Long Polling. . . , these tech-
niques allow us to leave some kind of “pipe” communication open                               (only one user logged in the space), and display the color scale with
