JSmol viewer (https://sourceforge.net/projects/jsmol/) can visualize some trajectory files (e.g., .xyz         NMR, cryo-electron microscopy
files) and can interpret structure files with multiple models (e.g., in .pdb files) as dynamic trajectories.   or X-ray crystallography.
Similar to MegaMol, JSmol is, however, only capable of reading very few trajectory file formats and
demands expert knowledge for usage.

More recently, the MDsrv was the first user-friendly tool to stream and visualize MD trajectories inter-
actively within web browsers without requiring expert knowledge and specialized software [31]. To
interact with many different (currently 22) trajectory formats, the MDsrv utilizes MDTraj [32] and the
MDAnalysis [33] software packages. By integrating the NGL viewer for web-visualization like RSCB
PDB [13], the MDsrv can display even huge trajectory files in various representations. The MDsrv en-
ables efficient handling of requests for any trajectory frame by not reading the whole file into memory
but by transferring only the information requested for visualization [29]. MD trajectory frames
rendered into a suitable representation editable by the user, for example, a cartoon representation
for the secondary structure and a licorice representation to highlight specific residues or a ligand, can
then be shared and accessed via any modern web browser.

About this time, HTMoL, another web-based MD visualization tool, was presented which also facili-
tates streaming and visualization of MD trajectories on the web [34]. Unique to HTMoL is its imple-
mentation of a fast visualization by direct calling of the graphics processing unit (GPU) that enables
rendering and parsing of trajectories from the three most commonly used trajectory formats – Gro-
macs [35], Charmm [36], and Amber [37]. This is performed by utilizing the Node.js runtime engine to
transfer MD trajectory binary data through a WebSocket connection (Box 3). An Apache HTTP server
is then applied to share and access trajectories via any modern web browser.

In comparison to MDsrv, HTMoL has a higher frame rate for small to medium-sized systems, most
likely due to its direct GPU usage. This means a smoother and faster loading of the trajectory frames
of those sized systems prior to their visualization. HTMoL is currently limited to only three file types
and to a reduced set of structural representations [34], while MDsrv can currently utilize 22 trajectory
file types and more than 20 structural representations [13,31–33]. HTMoL and MDsrv are alike in that
they both require the users to set up their own servers, either within a private network or the public
cloud. We believe that for wider adoption of these tools, hosted services that can access data from
scientific data sharing resources (Box 2) and do not require individual researchers to set up servers
would be highly beneficial. Moreover, web-based MD visualization tools are still far behind the

trajectories on the World Wide Web by MDsrv and HTMol, for example, opens up new possibilities for sharing. Sharing of MD simulations with colleagues
through interactive visualization promotes discussions and triggers new lines of investigations ultimately strengthening interdisciplinary research projects.
Moreover, interactive visualization may support the reviewing process of journals and funding agencies, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of
published MD simulation data and analyses. Interactive visualization may also broaden the outreach of MD simulations in society when used in teaching and
education. Adapted, with permission, from [76].

 Box 2. MD Data and Scientific Data Sharing Resources
 Files from MD simulations can be divided into input files, used for production, and output files. Depending on
 the software used such as GROMACS [35], NAMD [53], AMBER [37], DESMOND [54], or ESPResSo [55], many
 different input and output file formats are required and generated which are often incompatible. Input files are
 typically composed of starting structures, core force-field parameters, additional ligands, or other nonstandard
 atomic parameters and finally operated by detailed, ideally automated, and shareable protocols. For repro-
 ducibility/replicability, additional information about used software versions and computer/cluster systems
 has to be provided in addition to metadata, like configuration files and workflow scripts. However, so far,
 executable and easily reproducible protocols and metadata to generate and analyze MD studies are only rarely
 made available. The output of MD simulations consists of raw unprocessed trajectories including coordinates
 and velocities, energy, and log files. MD simulations belong to data-intensive sciences (also called e-sciences)
 like proteomics, genomics, oceanography, astrophysics, engineering, web sciences, and more. Sharing of raw
 or processed MD trajectory files is, accordingly, hampered by large file sizes. Nevertheless, scientific data
 sharing resources offer the possibility to deposit data even as huge as trajectories [56].

 In response to open science movements [57], numerous scientific general-purpose data repositories at scales
 ranging from institutional to open globally scoped repositories emerged. Scientific data sharing resources
 such as Dataverse [58], FigShare (http://figshare.com), Dryad [59], Mendeley Data (https://data.mendeley.
 com), Zenodo (http://zenodo.org), DataHube (http://datahub.io), OSF (https://osf.io), or NOMAD (https://
 nomad-coe.eu) accept a wide range of data types in a large variety of formats. The deposited data can be ac-
 cessed globally through a unique, preserved DOI. Compared with well-curated, special-purpose archives like
 the wwPDB, most scientific data sharing resources do not aim to integrate, harmonize, validate, or standardize
 the deposited data. Since appropriate references and metadata are often not available, it is difficult to filter
 suitable data from the huge variety of deposited files and databases. To overcome this challenge, the estab-
 lishment of information platforms summarizing and integrating available data should be instrumental in
 providing confidence in open source deposition concepts until global data standards are established. Web-
 sites such as https://fairsharing.org/ or https://okfn.org/ are helpful resources recommending repositories
 for scientific data, standards, and policies [60].




capabilities of stand-alone viewer programs such as VMD [19] or others highlighted here [38] that inte-
grate manifold built-in analysis tools like root mean square deviation (RMSD), radius of gyration, ex-
tracting min/max coordinates/distances, heat maps, contact maps, energy plots and many more.

Despite their differences, MDsrv and HTMoL allow instant and interactive dynamic web-based visu-
alization of MD trajectories through intuitive graphical user interfaces (GUIs). After set up of the
server by the MD simulation distributer, the data can be streamed directly through the web without
the requirement to download any trajectory data or to install software by the user/observer. The tra-
jectories become immediately available in the browser as soon as a link served by the creator of MD
simulations (also known as MD simulation distributer) is clicked by the user/observer. In addition, the
MDsrv and HTMoL visualization can be embedded into any website to be combined with other user-
specified analysis tools.


Towards Common Platforms for Sharing and Visualization
Scientific data can be shared through centralized or decentralized solutions. Centralized sharing op-
tions provide a highly efficient way to gather and distribute research results via the web. The wwPDB
serves as a blueprint for centralized solutions to share structural information via the web [24]. Precisely
curated data are accurately and richly annotated by data-depositing authors with easy on-the-point
keywords to ensure findability by the broader community. Additionally, all data deposited to the
wwPDB are freely and openly accessible and reusable. Furthermore, a major reason for the success
of the wwPDB is that most journals require structural biologists to upload their structure information
to the database prior to publication of their manuscripts. This synergistic effect has led to exception-
ally high citation rates of publications, especially on novel structures deposited in the wwPDB [39].

A similar positive effect could also be expected for MD simulations if trajectories and related data
would become accessible and interoperable at the moment of publication (Box 1). In contrast to

Box 3. Technical Developments Enabling Web Molecular Graphics
Molecular graphics have been a part of the web since its early days (Figure I). Initially, browsers could not
display 3D content by themselves but relied on plugins [e.g., Chime (MDL Information Systems, Inc. https://
www.umass.edu/microbio/chime/abtchime.htm)] or extensions (Java as used by Jmol [61] and OpenAstex-
Viewer [62]) that had to be installed in addition to the browser. Lack of access to hardware accelerated graphics
and inflexible data streaming have been major limitations for web molecular graphics. In recent years, ad-
vances in browser technology have opened up new possibilities for web molecular graphics and rendering
techniques [28].

Modern browsers now include native support for GPU hardware acceleration through the Web Graphics Li-
brary (WebGL) Application Programming Interface (API) (https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/
latest/). This enables web molecular graphics tools to provide fast 3D graphics on par with desktop programs.
In addition to GPU rendering, WebGL also includes support for handling binary data natively in the browser
which makes working with numerical and binary data much more efficient. Starting with GLmol (https://
github.com/biochem-fan/GLmol), the new browser capabilities have led to an explosion of web molecular
graphics tools, including PV (https://github.com/biasmv/pv), 3Dmol.js [63], NGL [13], Molmil [64], LiteMol
[65], and more (Figure I).

Nowadays, nearly all computers have multicore processors and the Web Workers API runs computations in
worker threads in parallel, leveraging the many cores of processors. As an additional benefit, the worker
threads perform tasks in the background without blocking the user interface. This is helpful for computationally
intensive tasks like calculating molecular surfaces and is employed, for example, by NGL and 3Dmol.js.

To provide real-time access to large amounts of data on demand, an efficient, low overhead data streaming
approach is often used. The WebSocket protocol (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455) enables this interaction
between a web browser and a web server and is much more efficient than the traditional HTTP protocol (as used
by MDsrv [31]). WebSockets are used by HTMol [34] and MegaMol [29,30] to stream MD trajectories to a web
browser.

A new generation of web applications is leveraging these tools enabled by the advances in browser technol-
ogies for modern computer-aided drug design [66] and general molecular sciences [22]. Additionally, a new
collaborative project, Mol* [67], was started to develop a common tool for web molecular graphics to better
meet visualization challenges.

data uploaded to the wwPDB, MD simulations can accumulate huge trajectory files ranging from
gigabytes to terabytes, which may raise concerns about a sharable solution for storage and handling
(see Outstanding Questions). However, sharing of huge amounts of data is feasible as demonstrated
by other data-intensive science fields. The Galaxy Project [40] is a prominent example showing how
community fostered standards and guidelines promote efficient and accurate sharing and reuse of
huge genomic data [41].

Nevertheless, the establishment of centralized sharing platforms requires many efforts, guidelines,
community engagement, and a central dedicated and sustainably funded organization [42]. Commu-
nity engagement is crucial as any centralized organization has to be guided by the community. The
wwPDB has, for example, various task forces for validation, format development, and regarding new
experimental techniques [43,44]. Centralized, special-purpose MD platforms may accordingly be
considered a first step on the way towards the establishment of global MD platforms. Several such
platforms have already been created (Table 1), but only BIGNASim [45] and GPCRmd (http://www.
gpcrmd.org/) feature interactive visualization of trajectories. BIGNASim is a platform containing a
database system and analysis portal for MD simulations of nucleotides [45]. It includes a comprehen-
sive analysis tool package and a spartan interactive visualization of trajectories by JSmol, limited to
play and pause. Curated simulations by users can be up- and downloaded. Moreover, a reduced
version of BIGNASim can be installed as a local platform to serve sensitive or unpublished data via
Docker images by individual researchers/MD simulation distributers.

The GPCRmd is a comprehensive database and web platform for MD simulations of GPCRs and
related analysis (http://www.gpcrmd.org/). It uses the MDsrv for interactive visualization of trajec-
tories with predefined settings to highlight GPCR specific features (Figure 2). Linked to the MDsrv
are pharmacological, biochemical, or biophysical data like mutations or X-ray crystallography density
maps and an interactive, topic-specific Flareplot analysis (https://gpcrviz.github.io/flareplot/). The
platform has a descriptive, easily searchable framework and includes an application for simulation
setup and deposition, also available with unique idem/DOI. Similar to the Galaxy Project [40],
GPCRmd is discussed, designed, and influenced by a research community which makes the platform
frequently used, widely supported, and sustainable.

For research areas and fields where no centralized sharing platforms are available, individual researchers or
groups can enrich their own websites with embedded simulations (e.g., http://nglviewer.org/mdsrv/
examples). In contrast to the default settings of centralized options, sharing through decentralized solu-
tions allows the creator of MD simulations to define study specific pre-settings. Analogously, user-specified
analysis tools can be combined with interactive visualization in a modular fashion. As an example, iBIOMES
facilitates searchability and findability by providing a metadata schema for indexing and summarizing MD
data in a web-searchable representation [46,47]. In summary, decentralized options may be used by scien-
tists preferring instant, independent and creative solutions for sharing and publication of MD trajectories.
Moreover, it may be the primary way to share trajectories with collaboration partners fostering critical dis-
cussions already on an early stage of the project.


Concluding Remarks and Future Perspectives
Visualization and sharing of MD trajectories can be considered initial steps towards a community
following the FAIR principles. We expect several lines of developments guiding this process, though
several issues remain to be resolved (see Outstanding Questions). Notably regarding shared visual-
ization in context of the FAIR principles, the data must be findable and accessible and sufficiently
interoperable to allow for visualization. Especially, findability suffers from poor description while reus-
ability suffers from missing verification for completeness and coherence of all MD data. In the broader
context of making MD simulations reproducible, the interoperability and reusability aspects become
more important. Currently, there are no widely accepted guidelines for making MD data globally find-
able or accessible. A comprehensive and constantly developing discussion and description is needed
to examine if full FAIR compliance can be obtained for all MD data, whether it is needed and how
much it would cost.

Figure 2. Screenshot from GPCRmd (http://www.gpcrmd.org/).
The interactive visualization is shown on the left panel: in the upper part, the embedded MDsrv is showing the molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory together
with X-ray crystallography density maps. Below, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-specific selection mode can be used to visualize GPCR-specific
structural features. The analysis (right panel) is interconnected to the interactive visualization by the MDsrv. By clicking on a link within the Flareplot
(right upper part), the hydrogen bonding network between those residues is directly visualized in the MDsrv (left upper part). On the right lower panel,
the time-dependent development of a distance between two atoms clicked within the MDsrv is plotted.


The availability of online tools for interactive visualization can set a novel standard for sharing of MD
trajectories: first, raw and unprocessed trajectories prior to extensive analysis can be shared within
workgroups to guide initial research, before sharing the MD outcome with collaborators and a
broader audience (Figure 1). This development accelerates as user-friendliness and acceptance of
tools for interactive visualization of MD trajectories improve and scientific data repositories become
standardized. Consciousness for interactive visualization and sharing options of MD simulations will
