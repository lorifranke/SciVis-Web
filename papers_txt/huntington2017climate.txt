    The summer of 2012 Great Plains drought stands
out as one of the most extreme drought events in
instrumental records (Hoerling et al. 2014), with esti-
mated total economic losses (largely from the agricul-
ture sector) of $35 billion (U.S. dollars). The Climate
Engine–derived June–August (JJA) EDDI map shown
in Fig. 3a highlights the large spatial extent of this
drought, with extreme and exceptional drought cat-
egories stretching from the Canadian to the Mexican
borders and encompassing approximately two-thirds
of the continental United States. Using the interannual
time series options and the spatial averaging feature of
Climate Engine, the time series illustrated in Fig. 3b
shows the accumulated summer ET0 anomaly averaged
over Missouri in 2012 was greater than 200 mm above
average and approximately 100 mm greater than the
previous record set in 1980.
    The MODIS normalized difference vegetation
index (NDVI) and LST anomalies are especially
useful for evaluating regional vegetation stress due
to drought. During the warm season, LST is largely
a function of the ET rate due to evaporative cooling
(i.e., latent heat flux). If ET is relatively low, then the
LST will be relatively high, and vice versa. Figures 3c
and 3d illustrate reduced NDVI and increased LST
during the summer of 2012 Great Plains drought
due to reduced vegetation vigor and ET, respectively.
Having multiple indicators of drought that are read-
ily accessible through on-demand cloud computing
and web visualization is extremely useful for better
understanding the drivers and impacts of drought
from multiple perspectives and disciplines (i.e., land
surface energy balance, vegetation, near-surface
boundary layer).
    Snow drought is a term that has been recently used
to describe the lack of snow depth or coverage that
occurs simultaneously with near-normal or above-              Fig. 4. Snow drought of 2015 over the northwestern

    and disputes. All of these issues are receiving high-
    priority attention in the western United States and in
    other water-limited environments around the world.
    The use of high-resolution satellite imagery is needed
    to accurately characterize spatial and temporal varia-
    tions in crop productivity, phenology, and water use
    over large areas. Given free access to the >30-year
    Landsat archive combined with Google Earth Engine,
    rapid field-scale assessments can be readily produced
    using Climate Engine.
        An example of a field-level analysis, where Climate
    Engine was used to generate maps of growing season
    maximum NDVI from Landsat for 2011 and 2015 over
    the Tulare Lake basin in the Central Valley of Califor-
    nia is shown in Fig. 7. Figures 7a and 7b clearly illustrate
    the large amount of fallowing that occurred in 2015 due
    to the multiyear drought. Melton et al. (2015) estimated
    that over 2,000 km2 of Central Valley cropland was
    fallowed in 2015, approximately twice that of 2011. A
    unique and very powerful feature of Climate Engine is
    the ability to extract field-level time series information
    related to vegetation vigor for anywhere around the
    globe using predefined polygons, user-uploaded Key-
    hole Markup Language (KML) files, or by dynamically
    drawing polygons on the map to define areas of inter-
    est. The latter option is applied in Fig. 7c to examine
    field-level crop phenology stages (dormant, green-up,
    full cover, and senescence/harvest periods) from 2011
    to 2015, clearly showing the fallowed land in 2015.
        Africa’s Sahel region is the semiarid zone just south
    of the Sahara, but north of the humid tropical zone of
    Africa. The agriculture, livestock, and human villages
    and pastoralists in this region are heavily dependent
    on rainfall. During late 2015 to early 2016, a strong El
    Niño contributed to regional shifts in precipitation in
    the Sahel region. Significant drought across Ethiopia
    resulted in widespread crop failure and more than
    10 million people in Ethiopia required food aid (U.S.
    Department of State 2016). Global precipitation data-
    sets can be used to detect local to regional anomalies
    in precipitation as a tool for devising early-warning
