b P2Rank with conservation (the default prediction model of PrankWeb).



   To carry out the prediction, users can either upload a
PDB file or provide a PDB ID, in which case PrankWeb
will download and store the corresponding PDB file from
the PDB database (30). In addition to selecting what pro-
tein to analyze, users can also specify whether evolutionary
conservation should be included in the prediction process,
which in turn determines which of the two pre-trained mod-
els will be used.
   Conservation scores are calculated using the Jensen-
Divergence method (31) from a multiple sequence align-
ment (MSA) file, which can come from three sources: (i)
users can specify their own alignment file, (ii) if a pro-
tein’s PDB code is provided, PrankWeb uses MSA from
the HSSP (32) database or (iii) where no MSA is provided
                                                                                  Figure 1. An example of PrankWeb output. The figure shows a predicted

which progress of the prediction process can be tracked and
results inspected once the process finishes.
   On the results page, PrankWeb utilizes LiteMol for visu-
alization of 3D structural information and Protael for se-
quence visualization. Figure 1 displays the predicted bind-
ing sites of dasatinib (a drug used for treatment of chronic
myelogenous leukemia) bound to the kinase domain of hu-
man LCK (PDB ID 3AD5). The sequence and structure
plugins are synchronized so that the user can easily locate
a sequence position in the structure and vice versa. The se-
quence view comprises predicted pockets, computed con-
servation and binding sites (if present in the PDB file). The
side panel displays information about the identified pockets
and a toolbar allowing the user to (i) download all inputs
and calculated results, (ii) share the results page link or (iii)
