KEY WORDS: 3D modelling, photogrammetry, 3D visualisation, panoramic images, integration, interactive visualisation


ABSTRACT:

Nowadays, there are rapid developments in the fields of photogrammetry, laser scanning, computer vision and robotics, together
aiming to provide highly accurate 3D data that is useful for various applications. In recent years, various LiDAR and image-based
techniques have been investigated for 3D modelling because of their opportunities for fast and accurate model generation. For
cultural heritage preservation and the representation of objects that are important for tourism and their interactive visualization, 3D
models are highly effective and intuitive for present-day users who have stringent requirements and high expectations. Depending on
the complexity of the objects for the specific case, various technological methods can be applied. The selected objects in this
particular research are located in Bulgaria – a country with thousands of years of history and cultural heritage dating back to ancient
civilizations. \this motivates the preservation, visualisation and recreation of undoubtedly valuable historical and architectural
objects and places, which has always been a serious challenge for specialists in the field of cultural heritage.
In the present research, comparative analyses regarding principles and technological processes needed for 3D modelling and
visualization are presented. The recent problems, efforts and developments in interactive representation of precious objects and
places in Bulgaria are presented. Three technologies based on real projects are described: (1) image-based modelling using a non-
metric hand-held camera; (2) 3D visualization based on spherical panoramic images; (3) and 3D geometric and photorealistic
modelling based on architectural CAD drawings. Their suitability for web-based visualization are demonstrated and compared.
Moreover the possibilities for integration with additional information such as interactive maps, satellite imagery, sound, video and
specific information for the objects are described. This comparative study discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these three
approaches and their integration in multiple domains, such as web-based 3D city modelling, tourism and architectural 3D
visualization. It was concluded that image-based modelling and panoramic visualisation are simple, fast and effective techniques
suitable for simultaneous virtual representation of many objects. However, additional measurements or CAD information will be
beneficial for obtaining higher accuracy.

asked to test it and to give their observations, recommendations

these users did not have any previous experience with such
