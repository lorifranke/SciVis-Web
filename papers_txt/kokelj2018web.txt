web browser limit of rendering 60 fps. All browsers do not
support WebVR application programming interface yet and
some headsets are limited to certain operating systems. With
the development of the technology and predicted growth in
the next years these limitations will gradually vanish.
   In the future we will try to optimize implementation of
VR functionality to make it faster and more user friendly.
We believe that VR will play important role in the future
of medicine and our improved application can be a good
example. In addition to optimizing currently supported options
for rendering there are still many techniques that we could
implement in the future to make our application better and
more user friendly.
