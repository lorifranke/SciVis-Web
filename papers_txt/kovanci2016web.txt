        The CELLmicrocosmos 4.2 PathwayIntegration (CmPI) is a tool which provides hybrid-
        dimensional visualization and analysis of intracellular protein and gene localizations in the
        context of a virtual 3D environment. This tool is developed based on Java/Java3D/JOGL
        and provides a standalone application compatible to all relevant operating systems.
        However, it requires Java and the local installation of the software. Here we present the
        prototype of an alternative web-based visualization approach, using Three.js and D3.js. In
        this way it is possible to visualize and explore CmPI-generated localization scenarios
        including networks mapped to 3D cell components by just providing a URL to a
        collaboration partner. This publication describes the integration of the different
        technologies – Three.js, D3.js and PHP – as well as an application case: a localization

1          Introduction
The CELLmicrocosmos 4.2 PathwayIntegration (CmPI) is a software framework which can be
used to visualize protein- and gene-related pathways in their cytological environment [1]. For
this purpose, CmPI supports the localization of these pathways by connecting to different
databases. The pathways can be easily imported using formats like GraphML (comprehensive
file format for graphs), SBML (System Biology Markup Language), AND Visio (PubMed-
based text mining data) and StringDB (Database of known and predicted protein-protein
interactions) [2–4]. CmPI also contains a network editor which can be used to generate
pathways and the 3D viewer supports 3D-stereoscopic visualization. Segmented cell
component models are based on the VRML97 format (Virtual Reality Modelling Language).
Nowadays, usually Blender or Fiji (Is Just ImageJ) are used for the model creation process [5],
[6].
Gene- or protein-related identifiers can be localized by connecting to the Bio Data Warehouse
(BioDWH)/DAWIS-M.D. or ANDCell [7–9]. The localization entries contained in DAWIS-
M.D. are derived from databases, such as UniProt, Reactome, and the Gene Ontology [10–12].
CmPI provides a number of different approaches to analyse and visualize different localization
scenarios. A single protein usually features a number of different localization entries which may

differ in the publication source, as well as in the associated cell component, or even the cell
component layer. For example, in our previous work we analysed the molecular environment
and co-localizations of the MPDZ/MUPP1-related protein and recently protein cascades in
cardiac phenotypes [13], [14]. A standard example which was used to verify the subcellular
localization process is the localization of the citrate cycle and the glycolysis [1]. Each
localization is based on a publication, a web link, or a text-mined abstract (in case of ANDCell).
Because the analysis of each and every localization entry is time consuming, an alternative
localization method was introduced: the Subcellular Localization Charts (SLC) [15].




                                                                                                        This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/).
The SLC provide a simplified way to predict common localizations among associated proteins.
These proteins may be associated by their corresponding pathway, by a direct reaction or
protein-protein interaction edge, or other text mining-based associations. It is possible to
analyse the overall localization of a pathway, or to visualize the localizations for all
proteins/genes.
Based on the localization strategy, different localization scenarios may be generated. And these
localization scenarios may be the base for further discussions with other scientists.
Another common problem for the localization prediction is the fact that molecules are traveling
inside cells; the cell components associated with corresponding genes/proteins often change
over time. In our approach, also different localization scenarios can be used to visualize
localization changes over time.
But usually it is not required that all scientists involved in the discussion install CmPI on their
computer. This is a redundant process in case the user only wants to visualize and explore a
distinct localization scenario without modifying it. To tackle this issue, a simple web-based tool
was developed which is able to visualize the localization scenarios in a convenient and easy
way. These Localization Scenarios can be used for the following purposes:
      •   discussion of different potential localization scenarios for particular gene/protein
          networks among scientists, combining functional and structural information,




                                                                                                        Copyright 2016 The Author(s). Published by Journal of Integrative Bioinformatics.
      •   representation of different time stamps of localization scenarios,
      •   illustration of intracellular pathways for educational purposes, or
      •   initial discussion of complex tours using the Space Map [16].
In summary, the main target group of the here introduced online tool are researchers who want
to explore specific localization scenarios created with CmPI.

2         Related Work
Related approaches which should be shortly discussed in this context are focusing 1) at the
visualization of cell models inside the browser, and 2) and the visualization of cytological
localizations of protein-/gene-related networks.

2.1       Browser-based Cell Visualization

As previously mentioned, our in-house tool CmPI is focusing at the visualization of cell maps.
A related approach is cellPACK, a software project which can be used in combination with
different 3D modelling tools, such as Blender or Cinem4D®, to develop complex mesoscopic
cell models [6]. But it is not focusing on the abstract visualization of networks in correlation
with cell models, its main purpose is to support 3D modellers during the modelling of cells by
combining different packing algorithms to create filled cells. cellVIEW is a tool based on the
commercial Unity3D® engine which can be used to visualize the models created with
cellPACK, but it is currently not available for the web browser and was not developed based
on WebGL [17].

Journal of Integrative Bioinformatics, 13(4):298, 2016                       http://journal.imbio.de/
Recently, a number of 3D web visualizations on the molecular level are being developed.
Jmol/JSmol or Jolecule are tools which can be used to visualize PDB files [18–20]. Also, the
related Protein Data Bank which provides the PDB files includes different 3D viewers
supporting the molecular level [18]. Other tools, such as Aquaria, provide hybrid-dimensional
visualizations, just like the tool discussed in this publication. Aquaria is combining 2D with 3D
visualization [21] with the subjective to visualize and analyse proteins based on the PDB format
in combination with their sequences [22]. Hybrid-dimensional browser visualization recently
gains growing popularity among biomedical scientists [23], [24].

2.2       Browser-based Localization Visualization of Biological Networks

All these third-party tools are focusing on the visualization of cellular structures, but our CmPI
additionally combines these cellular structures with subcellular localization information in 3D
space. Whereas there is – to our knowledge – no web-based tool available to visualize networks
in 3D cell environments, there is a tool supporting the visualization of localized 2D networks:
the previously-mentioned CellWhere [25]. Similar to the Cytoscape plugin Cerebral,
CellWhere uses 2D layouts to visualize gene-related networks in multiple abstract layers
representing cell components [26]. While CmPI is a tool which tries to support many different
organisms and is tissue-independent, CellWhere focusses on the localization of muscle-related
research. The localization process in CmPI is done semi-automatically by using the previously-
mentioned SLC, but the localization process in CellWhere is fully automatized by providing
confidence scores, which are also known from, e.g., COMPARTMENTS. The large advantage
of CellWhere is that the user is directly provided with the prediction of a single potential
localization scenario, but is it not possible to explore alternative localization scenarios.
The generation of different localization scenarios, especially in 3D space, is a unique feature of
CmPI, and CmPIweb is the first web tool which can be used to visualize these scenarios in the
browser.

3         Architecture/Implementation
To enable the visualization and exploration of the generated cell models associated with
localized pathways, the CELLmicrocosmos 4.2 PathwayIntegration web viewer (CmPIweb)
was developed.
CmPIweb required the following basic functionalities:
      •   loading of cell models in .Cm3 and .Cm4 format,
      •   visualization of 3D cell models associated with pathways in the browser,
      •   visualization of 2D networks in the browser, and
      •   visualization of a subset of Subcellular Localization Charts in the browser.

3.1       CmPIweb: Three-tier Architecture

To enable the integration of all previously described features in a simple way, a three tier
architecture was realized. Figure 1 illustrates the architecture.
PHP is used for transferring the files from the server to the client, decompressing ZIP archives
and local file handling (Figure 1). A particular requirement was the support for 100 MB+ files
via web, and here PHP was chosen as an appropriate technology. Moreover, the original
CELLmicrocosmos.org website which is hosting CmPIweb is also being developed in PHP.
Therefore, a seamless integration in the future will be possible.

Three.js is a WebGL framework providing a scene graph–based API and visualization and
exploration in most browsers, such as Chrome®, Firefox, Internet Explorer®, or Safari® [27].
The huge advantage of WebGL is the fact that all recent popular browsers support this standard
without any need to install additional browser plugins. Three.js supports also the VRML97
format, which is used by CmPI to import/export 3D cell models. In comparison to Java3D,
Three.js is a very recent technology which is more flexible and easy to use. Three.js is also
available with a number of stereoscopic 3D-related features, such as anaglyph, cross-eyed and
parallax barrier. We showed in a recent publication that the 3D-stereoscopic exploration is a
valuable approach to increase the insight into the structure of a cell [28]. For this reason, the




                                                                                                           This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/).
future extension of this tool into the third dimension could be a valuable approach. Moreover,
it is already implemented in CmPI. In addition, Three.js supports the import of different file
formats, such as binary code, images, scenes, and of course JSON. Three.js, Java3D as well as
VRML97 use a scene graph model to abstracting the 3D structures. Although VRML is a quite
old format, going back to 1995 (version 1.0) and 1997 (version 2.0), it is still often used as it is
a standard format which is supported by most 3D modelling packages such as Blender ][6],
[29]. The scene graph-based structure is, however, used by many other formats. It is also used
to create the cell models. Each cell component is represented by a 3D structure which is
positioned in 3D space by using the depicted structure. This similarity between Java3D, VRML
and Three.js was an important reason why Three.js for the development of CmPIweb.
D3.js (Data-Driven Documents) is a JavaScript–based visualization library providing fast
browser-based 2D visualization [30]. Many biomedical tools are nowadays using D3.js and
related approaches [31]. It can be used to create SVG objects which can further be useful for
large datasets that uses D3.js functions to generate rich text/graphic charts and diagrams.
Nowadays it is used by a wide range of visualization and analysis approaches which are found
at the corresponding webpage [32]. In CmPIweb it is used to visualize the 2D networks of the
biomedical pathways, as well as to visualize the localization charts shown on the bottom of
Figure 1. These charts are based on the previously discussed subcellular localization charts.

3.2       CmPIweb: Loading of Localization Scenarios

There are two ways to load different cell models containing cytological pathways into
CmPIweb, as shown in Figure 2:
      1) loading an external file by using a URL (GET parameter), or
      2) loading a local file by using a file chooser.
Using the first approach, the .Cm3 file (containing only a 3D cell model) or the .Cm4 file
(containing a 3D cell model plus the localized network) have to be packed as a ZIP file. The




                                                                                                                This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/).
ZIP file has to be uploaded to a server from where it is available via URL.
In case the file is loaded locally, the File-API is used. In this case, the user can select the local
files to be loaded into the browser application. It is possible to use the CmPI standard files,
consisting of .Cm3/.Cm4 and VRML 97 files, or by selecting a ZIP package containing all files.
Figure 2 (right) shows the online loading process. First, the ZIP file is downloaded to the server
of the web application. Then, it is unpacked on the server and then loaded into the memory of
the local computer. Once the loading is done, the file is deleted from the server.
In case the file is locally loaded, the loading process is only started on the local computer. As
unpacking and processing of a file is all done locally, no deletion operation takes place on the
server. The loading process of locally-stored files is much faster than for external files.

3.3       CmPIweb: Navigation

Because navigation is crucial in 3D environments, CmPIweb provides three navigation modes
based on the modes implemented in CmPI, but they are strongly simplified and optimized for
browser compatibility:
      •   Floating Mode: The user 'floats' in the cell environment by using WASD-keys or the
          mouse wheel to move forward/backwards. In addition, the following mode can be
          initiate via double click:




                                                                                                        This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/).
      •   Object-Bound Mode: The selected cell component or node is centred and the movement
          occurs around its centre by mouse movement while the left mouse button is pressed.
          Again with the mouse wheel forward/backward movement is triggered. This mode is
          suspended by double-clicking into an empty area.
      •   Flight Mode: By holding the CTRL key down, the user can fly forward by using the left
          mouse button, and fly backward, by using the right mouse button, whereas the mouse
          movement changes the direction.

4         Application
The following example was already discussed in the first version of CmPI: the combination of
the citrate cycle and the glycolysis [1]. It is a standard example because it is common knowledge
that the citrate cycle is attributed to mitochondria, and the glycolysis to the cytosol. By using
the previously-introduced SCL, it is a straight forward to predict the localization to the
corresponding localizations. This process is discussed in detail in the book chapter: “Network
Analysis and Integration in a Virtual Cell Environment” [33].
By using the following URL, the application is started in the browser by simultaneously loading




                                                                                                        Copyright 2016 The Author(s). Published by Journal of Integrative Bioinformatics.

nimal_Cell__1_72__hsa00010-20__1_4_2014[Cm4].zip
The first part of the URL represents the locations of the CmPIweb application, the second part
(non-bold font, starting with “?url”), represents the absolute path of the ZIP file to be loaded.
Figure 5 shows the loaded cell model. Here, the KEGG citrate cycle and the glycolysis are
shown (hsa00010 and has00020) [34]. The localization was previously done by using CmPI.
All localization results are visible to the user by using the bottom table on Figure 3 Top. But in
contrast to CmPI it is not possible to modify this table in CmPIweb – only the result can be
explored.
It is possible to change the colour of the different entries – for this purpose, it is just required
to click on the corresponding table entry representing a cell component on the right side of the
application shown in Figure 5. The colours of the citrate cycle as well as glucose cycle can also
be changed by clicking on the pathway table at the bottom of the application.
Obviously, the citrate cycle is localized at the mitochondrial region, whereas the glycolysis is
localized at the cytosol. This localization is a very straightforward task by using CmPI and the
result covers basic biological knowledge.
Figure 3 Top shows the complete cell environment associated with the metabolic network. The
3D view on the right side shows both pathways in 2D, drawn using the original KEGG layout
and depicting both pathways-connecting enzymes by inter-pathway edges.

    localization entries as derived from the databases of CmPI; Bottom Left: The SLC for enzyme
    4.1.1.32 selected in Figure 3 Bottom; Bottom Right: The Localization Table entry for 4.1.1.32

By moving towards the cell using the previously-discussed Floating Mode methods, the close-
up view of the mitochondrion associated with the citrate cycle (red colour) is created, as seen
in Figure 3 Centre. In the neighbourhood of the mitochondrion the glycolysis pathway
associated with the cytosol is visible.
Now, by zooming into the pathways using the 2D view, specific nodes become visible – here,
the enzyme 4.1.1.32. Now, a force-directed layout is used to mix both pathways, providing a
better overview concerning inter-pathway enzymes like 4.1.1.32. Now, a double click is
performed on this node in the 2D viewer, and the view automatically centres the corresponding
enzyme and the user can move towards the node by using the already discussed methods of the
Object-Bound Mode. Figure 3 Bottom shows the resulting view. On the right side the selected
and/or focused node is indicated in the 2D view by increased size.
Figure 4 Top shows the overview of the Subcellular Localization Charts. In this way, all
enzymes’ subcellular localizations are visible and comparable. Figure 4 Bottom shows
exclusively all localization entries for 4.1.1.32. The actually-selected localization is shown: the
“mitochondrion”, more precisely: its “Outer Membrane” of the species “homo sapiens”. “4/5”
indicates that this is the fourth of five localization layers (matrix, inner membrane,
intermembrane space, outer membrane, and the cloud). The result comes from the curated
BRENDA database [36]. Also, the localization references are shown which are linked to the
corresponding publications. By clicking on the actually-selected localization entry, the list of
all available entries is shown. In this way it is possible to explore alternatives. However, in
contrast to CmPI it is not possible at the moment to change the localization scenario based on
the changes in the table, as CmPIweb is only intended as a viewer.

5        Discussion and Outlook
Here, a simple approach was presented to visualize intracellular localized pathways by
combining web-based 2D and 3D visualization. In this way, hybrid-dimensional visualization
approaches was realized by using just a web browser (Figures 3 and 4) [21]. Since the
localization are based on often online-available data, they can be easily evaluated by clicking
on the corresponding localization sources at the bottom part of the Localization Table in Figure
4. Moreover, different localization scenarios can be discussed which might be especially




                                                                                                           This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/).
interesting in case the 3D structure of the cell is relevant for specific scenarios, like in case of
more complex protein cascades [14]. A big advantage would be also if explicit 3D coordinates
of molecular data could be provided, e.g. based on 3D MALDI technology [35]. An additional
important feature in this context would be the representation of cell structures by using
volumetric rendering. However, this will be a demanding task because the 3D rendering
performance of a browser is still quite limited. This limitation of a browser is also relevant for
CmPIweb, because it is recently not optimized for loading files with a size of multiple hundreds
of megabytes. Here, the standalone tool CmPI is the better option.
Also, other relevant visualization aspects can be observed. In Figure 3 Top, the whole cell is
shown, in Figure 3 Bottom, a detail is shown, focussing at the enzyme 4.1.1.32. This aspect is
called the Focus+Context paradigm which is often used for the presentation of biological data
[36]. While in the foreground, the actually relevant enzyme is shown in the focus, the
background – the context – shows the remaining reactions of the two metabolic pathways.
Moreover, the 2D view (Figures 3 right) is able to provide the complete overview of the
discussed pathways.
Related approaches, such as COMPARTMENTS and CellWhere provide statistical approaches




                                                                                                           Copyright 2016 The Author(s). Published by Journal of Integrative Bioinformatics.
to predict protein-related localizations [16], [17]. Although these resources provide fast access
and explicit predictions of subcellular localizations, often the processes behind the localization
prediction are not fully transparent. SLC provide an alternative of applying Visual Analytics-
related approaches to localization data provided by databases. But in near future it would be
preferable to combine both approaches: statistical prediction with user-in-the-loop analysis.
Because the localization scenarios only provide static snapshots of a cell, another important
feature in the future would be the support of dynamic data, enabling the illustration of changes
over time.
Scientists can utilize this tool as a source for their future research. In the future, it could be also
used as a part of a virtual graphical database network for biology and related fields. Based on
this web tool a web component could be developed to explore every possible biochemical
activity. Another important goal could be the future use to teach school and undergraduate
students the inner cell composition in an interactive way, associating the cellular structure with
3D networks. For this purpose, we are planning to optimize this tool in the near future for
mobile devices.
This can be on a cognitive basis highly effective, as the internal structure of a cell is spatially
spread and quite complex, comparable to a small universe. A future approach could be to use
the stereoscopic capabilities of Three.js to achieve better learning outcomes, as well as invoking
the interest in this technology in Bioinformatics [28].
This tool is meant to be a starting point for an improved understanding of microscopic
mechanisms in a more convenient and easy way.
