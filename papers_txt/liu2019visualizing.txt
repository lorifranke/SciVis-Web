  ABSTRACT Despite the importance of mesoscale eddies, and other three-dimensional features discernable
  in numerical simulations of ocean circulations, to the understanding of oceanic heat transport and climate
  change, there are few dedicated three-dimensional visualization tools for scientists to use. This paper presents
  a framework for the visualization of three-dimensional (3D) ocean eddies in web browsers. The framework
  includes a feature-based eddy computation algorithm implemented by a standalone C++ program and a
  web graphics library-based 3D eddy viewer. Combining eddy extraction, tracking, query, and interactive
  visualizations in one workflow, the proposed framework is designed to facilitate the visual exploration
  and analysis of ocean eddies and thus help domain experts get more insight into the process of ocean
  circulation. In the framework, the feature-based algorithm significantly reduces the storage requirement of
  data and the rendering cost of visualization tasks by exploiting the coherence between consecutive data
  frames and focusing on just those regions of interest. The 3D eddy viewer presents eddy visualizations
  within a standard web browser, which enables the easy sharing of the tool and the results between scientific
  collaborators at different locations on diverse platforms without the need to install specialized software.
  In this paper, the general considerations in the design process as well as the technical facts of the framework,
  the application of the framework to a high-resolution regional ocean simulation, the general usage scenarios
  of the 3D eddy viewer and the user evaluation are discussed.

V. DATA AND COMPUTATION PERFORMANCE
A. DATA
The ocean data used for this study is from a multi-decadal
regional ocean model simulation [6]. The simulation was
performed using the Regional Ocean Modeling System
(ROMS) [18], which solves the incompressible, hydro-
static, primitive equations with a nonlinear free surface.
It employs orthogonal curvilinear coordinates in the horizon-
tal and a generalized topography following coordinate in the
vertical [6]. The simulation domain covers the major path of
the Gulf Stream through the northwest Atlantic (Figure 6).
   In this study, the implementation covers the most recent
three years (2005 - 2007) in the simulation with 1095 daily
NetCDF [13] files (approximately 1.67 GB per file). The
vertical coordinate and stretching functions follow the ROMS
conventions. For details about this particular simulation,

Our implementation of the eddy computation program was
performed on a Dell XPS desktop with an Intel Core i7-

3D geographic maps through the WebGL API. WebGL has
been adopted by most modern browsers, which allows users
to create beautiful and high-performance three-dimensional
applications, using the capabilities of the GPU in computers.
The viewer is written in JavaScript language with the support
of Three.js library [2], a JavaScript 3D Library for WebGL.
As a browser-running and open source product, EddyViz is
easy to get running and gives users a unique opportunity to
monitor what happening in the code and permits the adaption
of the code into their particular interests whenever needed.

wise (anti-cyclonic eddies) or counter-clockwise (cyclonic
eddies). These eddy instances were also visualized as a daily
eddy instance view in the center of the webpage. The visual-
ization gave the student an overall daily distribution and ori-
entation of cyclonic (green) and anti-cyclonic (purple) eddies.
The student found that most eddies have a tapering shape
and the two types of eddies were almost equal numbered in
this day. She also noticed that the anti-cyclonic eddies were
larger in size and were positioned to the north of cyclonic
eddies. To verify her judgement, the student clicked the button
‘‘Export Data Information’’ in the control panel to request the
basic information and statistics of the eddies in this day which
was displayed in a separated webpage.
   After having some overall understanding of the eddy
instances in this day, student A double clicked an eddy feature
(the 24th on the list) in the visualization to get more details
(note: an individual eddy feature can also be chosen from the
list on the right-hand side). The webpage then switched to
a ‘‘single eddy mode’’ where the selected eddy was visual-
ized independently with its basic information (i.e., location,
spin orientation, radius, depth, and volume) displayed in the
control panel. To observe different physical properties of
the chosen eddy, she color-coded the eddy by temperature,
salinity, and velocity magnitude successively with different
colormaps. Figure 8b illustrates the variation of temperature
on the surface of the eddy. As can be found from the figure,
the temperature of this eddy first reduces as the eddy pene-

2007. In the visualization, each timestep of an eddy path is represented as a simple glyph (skeleton) and is placed in a context of the ocean basin and
