despite the increasing interest in visualizing and processing
3D content on the Web, “current browsers are not designed to
manage the data-intensive and interaction-packed throughput
required by Web3D applications” [2].
   The design of industrial products is strongly affected by this
technology limitation, mainly because 3D assembly models
may easily reach huge sizes, being possibly made of up
to several hundred of parts, and are often endowed with
additional heterogeneous data to be visualized together with
the geometry. One of the main issues is the ability of visualize
individual hidden components [3], which may be arbitrarily
complex, and may occlude one the others. An example of this
configuration is illustrated in Fig. 1. To allow the inspection of
the internal parts, several solutions have been proposed, such
as playing with transparency values of some components up
to hiding them or using section views (as the one depicted in        Fig. 1: Sectioned view of a 3D assembly model with occluded
