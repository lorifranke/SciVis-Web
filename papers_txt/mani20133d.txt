books. These are very useful in training when it comes to deci-
sion making and treatment for a complex surgical procedure. One
of the major drawbacks of local software simulation systems is
that their limitation on content actuality and real-time updates [Birr
et al. 2012]. Currently there are several online as well as offline
e-learning systems ([Höhne. et al. 2003] and [Crossingham et al.
2009]) for teaching and learning anatomical basics using 3D sim-
ulations for interactive visualization. But most of the web-based
training systems require special plugins and none of them offer ac-
curate simulations based on patient data. So the learner end up
learning just the basics of surgical hand maneuvers and control pre-
cision techniques. One of the most detailed study about the impact
of online and offline e-learning portals has been done in [Pape-
Köhler et al. 2010]. They conclude that none of the technologies
have fulfilled all criteria in terms of curricular integrity, accuracy of
scientific content and validity.
