     Visualization of molecular structures is one of the most common tasks carried out by structural biolo-
     gists, typically using software, such as Chimera, COOT, PyMOL, or VMD. In this Perspective article,
     we outline how past developments in computer graphics and data visualization have expanded the un-
     derstanding of biomolecular function, and we summarize recent advances that promise to further trans-
     form structural biology. We also highlight how progress in molecular graphics has been impeded by
     communication barriers between two communities: the computer scientists driving these advances,
     and the structural and computational biologists who stand to benefit. By pointing to canonical papers
     and explaining technical progress underlying new graphical developments in simple terms, we aim to
     improve communication between these communities; this, in turn, would help shape future developments
     in molecular graphics.

processed as a static image. During the early 1990s to the 2000s, with the advent of molecular viewers, it was possible to display all these representations
interactively (here, a scene rendered with VMD). From mid-2000s, technical developments performed in computer graphics labs are changing the way of
visualizing molecular structures by better rendering molecular shapes. Now, it is possible to interactively construct and visualize crowded and large systems,
opening the way for mesoscale models (spanning thousands of Angstroms and containing millions of molecules) with a nearly atomic resolution.
