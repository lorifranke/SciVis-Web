3.1 System Architecture and Design
The system consists of the client and the server, the operations of
this application are presented in Fig 1. While a client sends a
request to access webpage, an applet file is sent to the client with
the page. Next, the client chooses the corresponding data option
and clicks the “download” button to send the request of
downloading the dataset from the server. A dataset is sent to the
client. After the client downloaded the dataset and stored it in the
local file system, the application processes the data and
implements the functions of image display, image processing, 3D
reconstruction and so on.

3.2 Image Data Access
There are three views of datasets which are provided by the
application, e.g. axial, sagittal, and coronal view. The initial
medical datasets are stored in axial orientation. In order to
improve the efficiency of sagittal and coronal view, the proposed
method converts the initial data into sagittal and coronal datasets
in the process of downloading data. Thus, image data access
includes not only the data storage, but also the data processing.
Finally, the client got three datasets by changing the storage order
of data, namely axial, sagittal, coronal dataset.
