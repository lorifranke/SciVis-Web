Chemozart: a web‑based 3D molecular
structure editor and visualizer platform

  Abstract
  Background: Chemozart is a 3D Molecule editor and visualizer built on top of native web components. It offers
  an easy to access service, user-friendly graphical interface and modular design. It is a client centric web application
  which communicates with the server via a representational state transfer style web service. Both client-side and
  server-side application are written in JavaScript. A combination of JavaScript and HTML is used to draw three-dimen-
  sional structures of molecules.
  Results: With the help of WebGL, three-dimensional visualization tool is provided. Using CSS3 and HTML5, a user-
  friendly interface is composed. More than 30 packages are used to compose this application which adds enough flex-
  ibility to it to be extended. Molecule structures can be drawn on all types of platforms and is compatible with mobile
  devices. No installation is required in order to use this application and it can be accessed through the internet. This
  application can be extended on both server-side and client-side by implementing modules in JavaScript. Molecular
  compounds are drawn on the HTML5 Canvas element using WebGL context.
  Conclusions: Chemozart is a chemical platform which is powerful, flexible, and easy to access. It provides an online
  web-based tool used for chemical visualization along with result oriented optimization for cloud based API (applica-
  tion programming interface). JavaScript libraries which allow creation of web pages containing interactive three-
  dimensional molecular structures has also been made available. The application has been released under Apache 2
  License and is available from the project website https://chemozart.com.

drawing window to show and edit the molecule. It is
accomplished by using angular.js templates.
  <div ui-view = “”> </div>
  At the end of the body tag, it is required to include all
the dependencies in the right order that vary from ven-
dor libraries to each Chemozart modules.
  Each template can be customized as well as the
stylesheets. Templates in JADE and their correspond-
ing stylesheets in LESS are located inside the app or com-
ponents folder inside the client folder based on their role.
Components such as menu bar, tool bar, status bar, periodic
table, help window and about window are located in the
components folder and the main template that puts these
components together is located in the app folder (Fig. 3).

This application is built with Angular.js on client-side. All the    architecture
components and libraries are a directive, a service or a con-
troller. For example, to create a button in the menu bar that
adds a carbon on the drawing window the following steps
could be used. In the first step, a service must be created.        After injecting the service, it should be assigned to the
                                                                    controller’s scope so it can be accessed in the view.

  This service returns a function that creates an instance           ul
