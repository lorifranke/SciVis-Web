                                                        Cesium is an open-source JavaScript library built on the Web Graphics Library (WebGL) for

                                                        graphics Application Programming Interface (API) based on OpenGL ES 2.0 –a standard API
                                                        for 2D and 3D graphics on embedded systems [5]. The web browsers implement WebGL API
                                                        as a Document Object Model (DOM) interface in HTML5 [6] Canvas elements, which allows

                                         presentation, logic and data layers. The presentation layer includes the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and
                                         the main canvas for 3D rendering. The logic layer contains a number of web services written in Python and
                                         deployed in Django Web Framework [7]. The data layer focuses on the storage and retrieval of data.
                                         doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0150883.g001

                                         which divides a large system into different areas of functionality so that the complexity of the
                                         system can be minimized and each layer can be designed and implemented separately and effi-
                                         ciently. This multilayer architecture also provides the highest level of encapsulation and isola-
                                         tion, which decouples the system and reduces the ripple effect of changes to the system. Fig 1
                                         illustrates the multilayered system architecture of the GPlates Portal.
                                             The presentation layer includes the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the main canvas for
                                         3D rendering. The GUI is developed with HTML5, JavaScript and Cascade Style Sheet (CSS)
                                         and can be used to control the main canvas and display additional information. The jQuery
                                         JavaScript library is used to help with the client-side scripting and the Cesium library is used to
                                         draw the 3D virtual globe and maps on an HTML5 Canvas.
                                             The logic layer contains a number of web services written in Python and deployed in Django
                                         Web Framework [7]. The Apache HTTP Server is used to handle the HTTP protocol between
                                         the Django Web Framework and clients. The HTTP requests are dispatched to corresponding
                                         web services by the Django Web Framework and the HTTP responses are delivered back to cli-
                                         ents through the same stack.
                                             The data layer focuses on the storage and retrieval of data. A set of data source adapters is
                                         created to decouple the web services from the data storage details. The data source adapters read
                                         a Data Source Description (DSD) file in JSON format to retrieve and feed data back to web ser-
                                         vices. The web services only interact with an abstract interface of data source adapters, so any
                                         changes to the data storage are completely transparent to the web service. This decoupling
                                         allows us to change the data storage details without affecting the web services. Currently, our
                                         data sources include files on local volumes, tables in a PostGIS [8] database, objects in Amazon
                                         Simple Storage Service (S3) [9] and some external data sources hosted by collaborators.

                                         software version mismatches. Bug fixes can be delivered quickly and easily. Users do not have
                                         to wait for the next release to get the bugs fixed.
                                             Connectivity and resources sharing. In the Internet era, it is important that resources are
                                         connected and shared. The resources, such as computation, storage and software functionality,
                                         can be utilized more efficiently in a connected environment and users can collaborate more
                                         efficiently because data are connected and shared.
                                             Platform independence. Users only need an Internet connection and a web browser to
                                         access the GPlates Portal. There is no significant platform restriction. The Cesium web applica-
                                         tions harness modern technology to give users an interactive 3D experience. Users can rotate
                                         the globe, adjust the angle of view, change the height scale, and zoom into the very details of
                                         high resolution raster and terrain. Some portal applications are able to calculate data at a speci-
                                         fied time/age according to the user input.
                                             Cloud Hosting. The GPlates Portal is hosted in the cloud. Cloud hosting provides the fol-
                                         lowing advantages, compared with traditional on-premises installation:
                                         1. Scalability and flexibility. The traffic to our web services is highly variable. Spikes in the
                                            number of page requests coincide with the publication of datasets associated with high-
                                            impact journal articles, when the articles attract wide-spread media attention and general
                                            public interest. In light of the variable usage, it is important for the system to adjust its
                                            capability on-demand. The Cloud’s Auto Scaling service allows us to scale the system’s
                                            capacity up or down automatically according to the conditions. This auto scaling ability is
                                            important to ensure the quality of our web services without incurring a substantial infra-
                                            structure cost.
                                         2. Lower cost and pay as you go. Using cloud hosting keeps the cost of hardware purchase
                                            and maintenance to a minimum. Furthermore, unneeded virtual machines in the Cloud
                                            can be terminated at any time, thus eliminating the issues related to disposal of computer
                                            hardware.
                                         3. Launch virtual machine at designated locations. There is an obvious pattern in the distribu-
                                            tion of user locations, which are mostly within Australasia, Europe and the USA. The Cloud
                                            allows us to launch virtual machines in these designated regions to improve the speed of
                                            network access.




                                         Free Software for Globe Design
                                         One of the basic principles of the scientific method is that research results should be reproduc-
                                         ible and independently verifiable [10] and one of the key components of reproducibility is
                                         open software. Free software is used in the development of the GPlates Portal, which gives
                                         readers easy access to the tools required to repeat the method described in this paper. The 3D
                                         rendering engine, Cesium Version 1.7.1 (http://cesiumjs.org/downloads.html), is released
                                         under the Apache 2.0 license. The reconstruction engine, GPlates/PyGPlates Version 1.5

                                              Virtual Globe Design and Construction
                                              Introduction
                                              Virtual globe design and construction consists of 4 major steps (Fig 2): (1) preparing imagery
                                              tiles, (2) preparing terrain tiles, (3) serving imagery and terrain tiles over the internet, and (4)
                                              building the application. The detailed methodology involved in design and construction,
                                              including python scripts, is available in S1 Text and supplementary python scripts are archived
                                              in S1 Archive.

                                              Design and functionality of individual virtual globes
                                              In the following sections we describe a series of virtual globes that we have created as part of
                                              the GPlates Portal. Each globe is a companion to a published scientific research article. Indeed,
                                              each globe can be regarded as a powerful supplementary resource to these studies, allowing
                                              anyone with a web browser to visualize and interact with large data sets, reconstructions, and
                                              geodynamic simulation output that can only be partly represented within the limitations of a
                                              journal article.

                                              High-resolution topography and bathymetry
                                              There are many Earth processes that can only be understood by mapping the topography of the
                                              deep oceans at high resolution. These include small-scale features such as abyssal hills, small
                                              seamounts (< 1 km tall), fractures that form on the outer walls of deep ocean trenches, and the
                                              erosional incisions on the seaward slopes of the continental margins. A new global grid of land
                                              topography and ocean bathymetry called SRTM15_PLUS (15 arc second resolution) was
                                              recently developed [11] following the methods of the SRTM30_PLUS grid [12]. The land topog-
                                              raphy is based on the SRTM3 mapping by the space shuttle in 2000 [13]. This is augmented by

                                          SAT altimetry data for the ice caps of Greenland and Antarctica. The new aspect of the grid is
                                          the global bathymetry which is based on publically available depth soundings from a wide array
                                          of sources combined with the latest global bathymetric prediction from the global marine grav-
                                          ity grid discussed above [14]. In particular, high-resolution (100–200 m) multibeam echo
                                          sounder data from oceanographic institutions around the world [e.g., Lamont, Scripps, Woods
                                          Hole, JAMSTEC, GEOMAR, IFREMER, etc.] cover about 11% of the area of the oceans at 15
                                          arcsecond resolution (~500 m). The older single-beam soundings from a global compilation
                                          maintained at the US National Geophysical Data Center provide 1 km spatial resolution over an
                                          additional 6% of the seafloor. Depths on the remaining 83% of the seafloor are interpolated
                                          from the global gravity grid [15]. This wide variety of data was assembled using the remove/
                                          restore method to bootstrap from the SRTM15_PLUS compilation. The assembly made exten-
                                          sive use of Generic Mapping Tools [16] for gridding as well as masking land/ocean areas. The
                                          SRTM15_PLUS grid will form the basis for the next version of Google Earth and is publicly
                                          available at ftp://topex.ucsd.edu/pub/srtm15_plus/.
                                              While all of the source data are publicly available and have been analyzed, the global assem-
                                          bly provides a new perspective on several types of ocean features. First, the spatial variations in
                                          abyssal hill fabric, not well resolved at 30 arc seconds, are now visible along most of the seafloor
                                          spreading ridge axes as well as some well surveyed areas with thin sediment cover. The ampli-
                                          tude and orientation of this abyssal fabric provides a window into the past spreading rate and
                                          direction. Significant new multibeam coverage from JAMSTEC in the Western Pacific provides

                                             Seafloor lithology
                                             The world’s ocean floor is draped by a vast blanket of sediments, which forms the largest geo-
                                             logical deposit and the largest carbon sink on Earth (Fig 4). The composition of these sedi-
                                             ments is highly variable and includes remains of plankton that have settled through the ocean
                                             column, terrigenous particles derived from continents and chemical precipitates that have
                                             formed in situ on the seafloor. The distribution of these sediments is critical for understanding
                                             how Earth has responded and continues to respond to environmental changes, the behavior of
                                             ocean currents, the occurrence of metal deposits and the assessment of geohazards. The recent
                                             publication of the first digital map of seafloor sediments based on the analysis and classification
                                             of nearly 15,000 surface sediment samples [17], provides a long overdue update on a highly
                                             generalized hand-drawn map of global seafloor sediments that dates back to 1974 [18] and fea-
                                             tures in virtually every textbook of marine geology and oceanography. The digital map was cre-
                                             ated using a bespoke machine-learning algorithm [17] and allows the joint analysis of these
                                             categorical data with oceanographic data that are freely available, for instance, through the

                                         Vertical gravity gradient
                                         Gravity models are powerful tools for mapping the structure of the ocean floor, especially in the
                                         deep ocean basins where the topography remains unmapped by ships or is buried by thick sedi-
                                         ments. A recently published global marine gravity model [14], which is twice as accurate as pre-
                                         vious models, has here been combined with the continental gravity model EGM2008 [19] to
                                         produce a global model for the free-air gravity field. The digital free-air gravity model was used
                                         to compute the vertical gravity gradient, which enhances small-scale gravity anomalies, related
                                         to tectonic structures such as small seamounts and faults, horst and graben structures at the sea-
                                         bed or buried underneath the seafloor. The vertical gravity gradient is particularly useful for
                                         visualizing deep structures associated with continental margins and sedimentary basins, where
                                         seismic imaging data are sparse and expensive to obtain. The vertical gravity gradient dataset
                                         was used to create the first of the GPlates Portal virtual Cesium globes in October 2014; it has
                                         since been viewed nearly 100,000 times (31st January 2016). While thousands of meters of water
                                         obscure our view of the array of geological features characterizing the seabed and buried sub-
                                         seafloor geology, the marine portion of this globe reveals many previously unknown seafloor
                                         and sub-seafloor structures, including an extinct mid-ocean ridge from the Jurassic Period in
                                         the Gulf of Mexico (now buried by up to 8 km of sediments) and a huge ancient rift scar in the
                                         South Atlantic Ocean formed by a deep-seated “hotspot” leading to a cracking of the ocean floor
                                         [14]. By providing a seamless view of the combined marine and continental gravity field, this
                                         Cesium globe allows the user to follow structures from the deep ocean basins to continental
                                         slopes and shelves to the continents themselves. Such structures may include oceanic fracture
                                         zones, many of which have an origin in tectonic lineaments in the continental crust which
                                         existed before continental breakup [20], as well as meteorite impact structures (Fig 5).

                                         Global magnetic anomalies
                                         Ferrous minerals in the crust and upper mantle give rise to magnetic anomalies. The strength
                                         and shape of these anomalies reflects the mineralogy and thickness of geological formations.
                                         Since minerals become non-magnetic above their Curie temperature, magnetization has a lim-
                                         ited depth extent, which depends on the local temperature gradient of the lithosphere. Mag-
                                         netic anomalies therefore provide insight into subsurface structure, composition and heat flow
                                         in the Earth's crust. Anomalies trending parallel to the isochrons (lines of equal age) in the
                                         oceans reveal the formation (seafloor spreading) and destruction (subduction zones) of oceanic
                                         crust, the formation of continental crust by accretion of various terranes to cratonic areas and
                                         large-scale volcanism on continents and in the oceans.
                                             Magnetic anomaly data have been collected by ships, aircraft, and low-orbiting satellites for
                                         more than half a century, providing global coverage of the Earth. The Earth Magnetic Anomaly

                                              processed, line levelled and merged at 4 km altitude using least squares collocation. Two ver-

                                              with anisotropic (directional) gridding over the oceans, in which the anomalies were “stretched
                                              out” in the direction of the local isochrons as given by the oceanic crustal age model [23]. A

                                              Global magnetic anomaly identifications
                                              Marine magnetic anomaly identifications are one of the primary building-blocks of global plate
                                              reconstructions, used to determine the age of the oceanic crust and to understand past sea-
                                              floor-spreading processes. These magnetic anomaly identifications, often called “magnetic
                                              picks”, are a spatio-temporal representation of interpreted marine magnetic anomalies
                                              described above against a geomagnetic reversal timescale. In the past, most global and regional

                                              anomaly identifications was recently established [25]. The repository contains consistently
                                              described and well-documented data points that have undergone internal quality-control.
                                              While all the data have been made accessible to the public via a dedicated website (www.soest.

                                              Gravity and magnetic grid reconstruction through geological time
                                              Since geophysical signatures of the oceans and continents contain information about past plate
                                              configurations, a natural step is to reconstruct these data using models for past plate configura-
                                              tions, both to validate existing models and explore alternative scenarios. The GPlates desktop
                                              software provides functionality to perform high-resolution raster reconstructions [26]. Differ-

                                              plates linked to a global rotation model that describes how all major plates have moved relative
                                              to each other, and relative to the Earth’s spin axis, since 200 million years ago [27]. The work-
                                              flow is straightforward for experienced GPlates users, but barriers exist to the wide use of such
                                              technologies—users need to download and install GPlates software, access and store large vol-

                                            Convective motions within the Earth’s mantle result in deformation of its surface that is often
                                            referred to as “dynamic topography”. We recently developed a method to use global tectonic
                                            reconstructions as boundary conditions of mantle flow models [28], which allows us to model

                                                 from mantle flow deeper than 350 km. The calculations use either free-slip or no-slip boundary
                                                 conditions, and the reader is referred to the publications associated with the models available
                                                 on the GPlates Portal for further details of each calculation of dynamic topography.
                                                    The results of our global models show that the interplay between the motion of tectonic

                                         of dynamic topography at a given point can be plotted (Fig 9C) and downloaded in csv format.
                                         Current models extend back to 230 Ma and do not include active mantle upwellings [31, 32].
                                         However, we are currently working on models which extend further back in geological time
                                         and include active mantle upwellings, and they will eventually be added to the GPlates Portal.

                                         Discussion
                                         Complementary roles of web-based versus desktop virtual globes
                                         The difficulties in developing interactive browser-based tools to substitute a given desktop
                                         application used to be prohibitive until recently, certainly for scientists outside of major
                                         national research institutions. However, now a new generation of open-source tools is facilitat-
                                         ing a “virtual globe revolution” by allowing researchers anywhere to participate in the construc-
                                         tion of online virtual globes. The GPlates Portal is an example of this revolution and represents
                                         a new way to visualize and share geophysical and geological data. Compared to traditional
                                         desktop software applications, the main advantage of the GPlates Portal web applications is the
                                         software distribution model Software as a Service (SaaS). In the SaaS model, the software appli-
                                         cations are hosted by service providers and made available to users via the Internet and the
                                         access to services is usually controlled by user subscriptions.
                                            Web-based applications such as the GPlates Portal still have limitations compared to more
                                         traditional applications. For example, the GPlates desktop software contains a range of tools
                                         for ‘power-users’ to perform complex tasks such as interactively modifying reconstructions,
                                         visualizing evolving plate boundaries geometries and plate kinematic indicators. Applications
                                         within the GPlates Portal are deliberately free of such complications, and are designed to com-
                                         plement desktop applications rather than replace them—they provide a more streamlined,
                                         user-friendly interface to explore the same data sets and reconstruction models used in desktop
                                         applications. Traditionally, scientists have shared plate reconstructions through animations, or
                                         more recently through video-sharing sites such as Youtube (www.youtube.com/channel/
                                         UCa41IQEhmmuXmz9J6iMfsnA). Such animations are inherently limited since they are not
                                         interactive—GPlates portal applications perform a similar function to such animations, but are
                                         vastly more powerful, providing an immersive environment for users to interact with scientific
                                         datasets.

                                         Future Extensions
                                         The GPlates Portal has been designed as a gateway to a knowledge and service hub for geolo-
                                         gists and geophysicists interested in understanding Earth’s surface and crustal structure and
                                         Earth evolution through geological time. Any researchers investigating spatial data sets can uti-
                                         lise the technologies described here to generate their own virtual globes of raster, vector or
                                         point data, overlain over a digital terrain model, based on the open software underpinning
                                         globe design. Our experience shows that raster data are best suited for fast interactive globe
                                         visualization, while large volumes of vector or point data overlays tend to make interactive
                                         globe manipulation more sluggish. Future opportunities for extension of virtual globe func-
                                         tionality include allowing users to submit their own data to create customized Cesium applica-
                                         tions. Customized Cesium applications may be created automatically based on the data
                                         provided by users. In this way, even users with little knowledge about web application develop-
                                         ment can publish and visualize their data interactively in the Cloud. Future functionality will
                                         also include making big data mining workflows accessible as services on the Cloud. Finally, the
                                         establishment of RESTful web services will migrate some functionality of the desktop GPlates
                                         software [33] into the Cloud. The portal already includes a prototype for a paleomapmaker,

                                         designed to allow users to export publication-quality figures using datasets and reconstructions
                                         contained within the portal data store or uploaded directly by users.

                                         Conclusions
                                         The GPlates Portal provides a series of virtual globes that put fast interactive visualization of
                                         global geophysical and geological data sets and paleomap-making into the hands of public end-
                                         users. The portal has been visited nearly 300,000 times since its inception in October 2015, as
                                         tracked by google analytics, and the globes have been featured in numerous media articles
                                         around the world. They have helped illustrate online articles on published research papers by
                                         media either providing links to a given virtual globe or by embedding a globe in their own web
                                         page. In this way the globes have started playing a significant role in helping to communicate
                                         research to the public. Their popularity demonstrates the demand for fast visualization of
                                         global spatial big data, both for the present-day as well as through geological time. The cloud-
                                         based Cesium globes offer many future opportunities for providing additional functionality,
                                         especially on-the-fly big data analytics.
