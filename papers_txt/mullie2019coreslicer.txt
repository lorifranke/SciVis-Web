CoreSlicer: a web toolkit for analytic
morphomics
Louis Mullie1,2 and Jonathan Afilalo1,2,3*


  Abstract
  Background: Analytic morphomics, or more simply, “morphomics,” refers to the measurement of specific
  biomarkers of body composition from medical imaging, most commonly computed tomography (CT) images. An
  emerging body of literature supports the use of morphomic markers measured on single-slice CT images for risk
  prediction in a range of clinical populations. However, uptake by healthcare providers been limited due to the lack
  of clinician-friendly software to facilitate measurements. The objectives of this study were to describe the interface
  and functionality of CoreSlicer- a free and open-source web-based interface aiming to facilitate measurement of
  analytic morphomics by clinicians - and to validate muscle and fat measurements performed in CoreSlicer against
  reference software.
  Results: Measurements of muscle and fat obtained in CoreSlicer show high agreement with established reference
  software. CoreSlicer features a full set of DICOM viewing tools and extensible plugin interface to facilitate rapid
  prototyping and validation of new morphomic markers by researchers. We present published studies illustrating the
  use of CoreSlicer by clinicians with no prior knowledge of medical image segmentation techniques and no formal
  training in radiology, where CoreSlicer was successfully used to predict operative risk in three distinct populations
  of cardiovascular patients.
  Conclusions: CoreSlicer enables extraction of morphomic markers from CT images by non-technically skilled
  clinicians. Measurements were reproducible and accurate in relation to reference software.
