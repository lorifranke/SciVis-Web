and proteins, as well as secondary structures were performed
using standard Open Babel functions; e.g. OBConversion to

GetResidueProperty and GetAtomProperty functions were
used to identify proteins, ligands, ions, and water molecules.

torsions for two sets of four consecutive atoms (i.e., the φ- and
ψ-angles) being in the range of 95−115°) when parsing PDB
ﬁles. When an alpha-helix was encountered a slightly diﬀerent
protocol was used. That is, only alpha carbons were used as
control points to create a smooth-looking spiral, as compared
to the standard ribbon depiction. The ribbon mesh was created
using a modiﬁed version of StarManta’s TubeRenderer.34 To
obtain an elliptic, almost ﬂat shape the original tube was
modiﬁed by dividing the y-axis value by an arbitrary factor of
10. The same approach as for the alpha-helix of ribbons was
used to visualize the C-alpha trace, although using a small
radius, making the representation to appear as a line.

medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. This smaller group of
