              The network of ﬁlaments with embedded clusters surrounding voids, which has been seen in maps derived from
              redshift surveys and reproduced in simulations, has been referred to as the cosmic web. A complementary
              description is provided by considering the shear in the velocity ﬁeld of galaxies. The eigenvalues of the shear
              provide information regarding whether or not a region is collapsing in three dimensions, which is the condition for
              a knot, expanding in three dimensions, which is the condition for a void, or in the intermediate condition of a
              ﬁlament or sheet. The structures that are quantitatively deﬁned by the eigenvalues can be approximated by iso-
              contours that provide a visual representation of the cosmic velocity (V) web. The current application is based on
              radial peculiar velocities from the Cosmicﬂows-2 collection of distances. The three-dimensional velocity ﬁeld is
              constructed using the Wiener ﬁlter methodology in the linear approximation. Eigenvalues of the velocity shear are
              calculated at each point on a grid. Here, knots and ﬁlaments are visualized across a local domain of
              diameter ~0.1c .

Figure 6. A great ﬁlament runs from the Great Attractor at the heart of Laniakea Supercluster through Norma–Pavo–Indus, across the Arch that forms a far boundary
of the Local Void, to the Perseus–Pisces structure. Midway along the Arch, there is a point of bifurcation between local ﬂows that head to Perseus–Pisces and local
ﬂows directed toward the Great Attractor. This scene appears at 5:55 in the animation of Figure 1.




Figure 7. Our relationship to the Great Attractor is shown. Flow streamlines in our vicinity at the origin of the arrows pass by the Virgo Cluster and along the Virgo
strand to arrive at the Great Attractor in the region of the Centaurus and Norma clusters. A V-web ﬁlament iso-surface extends from the Great Attractor through Virgo
to ﬁnally reach the Perseus–Pisces complex. Individual galaxies in the selected volume are drawn from 2MRS. Galactic obscuration lies in a horizontal belt coincident
with the red arrow (supergalactic SGX, with SGZ normal to the ﬁgure), accounting for the lack of galaxies in that band. Tones of blue through yellow and red map
