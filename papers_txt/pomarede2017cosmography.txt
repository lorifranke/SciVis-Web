                                                       Cosmography, the study and making of maps of the universe or cosmos, is a field where vi-

                                                   At the extragalactic distance scales, visualization is contributing in understanding the complex

Fig. 1.— The SDvision widget engaged in the visualization of multiple isosurfaces of the cosmic V-web. The
velocity web cartographied here is extracted from the analysis of the eigenvalues λi=1,2,3 of the velocity shear
tensor. Five surfaces of constant values of the λ3 eigenvalue, shown here in several nuances of red, trace
the knots of the web. A surface of constant value of the λ2 eigenvalue, shown in gray, traces the filaments.
The view is augmented with annotations and polylines indicating the most salient cosmographic structures.
These annotations and polylines are added to the transformable model like the other graphics objects. A
three-dimensional signpost made of three colored arrows (red, green, blue) is anchored on the origin of the
Supergalactic coordinate system, that is the location of the Milky Way, with each arrow associated to its
three cardinal axes (SGX, SGY, SGZ).

Fig. 2.— The SDvision widget engaged in the visualization of a thin slice of the XSCz catalog of redshifts.
Our galaxy, the Milky Way, resides at the origin. The positions of galaxies are given in the Supergalactic
coordinates system in units of redshift. The butterfly like distribution is typical of the redshift surveys
viewed in the SGY-SGZ and SGX-SGY projections, where the obscuration by our galactic plane creates a
three-dimensional wedge in the data sample where no measurements are available, the so-called “Zone of
Avoidance”.

Fig. 5.— Visualization of peculiar velocities and Wiener Filter products. The galaxies of the Cosmicflows-2
Catalog selected in a thin slice -500 km/s < SGZ < +1500 km/s are shown as white speckles. Their peculiar
velocities are shown as three-dimensional arrows colored blue for inward motions and red for outward motions.
The white polylines are streamlines of the velocity field reconstructed by the Wiener Filter, seeded at each
galaxy location. These streamlines are “long” streamlines, in the sense that their reconstruction is pushed
far enough so that each of them reach an attractor. The grey Gouraud-shaded polygon is an isosurface of
the reconstructed density field. This high-density surface reveal the presence of the most massive players of
the local universe: the Great Attractor, Perseus-Pisces, and Coma. A more modest high-density patch, the
Arrowhead, is also identified. A thin slice of the density field is also rendered as a rainbow-color contour
image, showing nuances in the available densities, deep blue corresponding for example to voids in the
cosmography. This whole visualization conveys much of the essence of the Cosmicflows Project: peculiar
radial velocities are used as input to a Wiener Filter algorithm that produces a 3D velocity field, used
itself to derive the density field and to search for structures in the distribution of the streamlines, the
visualization allowing the exploration of all these ingredients all together. Here the whole process results in
the identification of the Arrowhead basin of attraction inside which the streamlines converge on an attractor.

Fig. 6.— Visualization of cosmic flows. This map of the Supergalactic equatorial plane (SGZ=0) is obtained
using “short” streamlines: short in the sense that their reconstruction is halted at a given number of steps
without pursuing the convergence onto an attractor. Here, each single streamline benefits from it own
local 3D velocity field, obtained by separation of the local (divergent) component of the velocity field from
the external (tidal) component. This combination of using a local field and short streamlines results in
the mapping of very local flows (at the cost of a single arbitrary parameter, the radius of the sphere of
divergent/tidal separation). This process reveals a structure of adjacent basins of attraction, whether fully
reconstructed (Laniakea, Arrowhead) or partially reconstructed (Perseus-Pisces, Coma, Shapley) due to their
location on the edges of the data sample. This map is also powerful in illustrating the concept of evacuation
of the flow from the voids. Also shown is a rainbow-color contour image of the density field that provides
additional context: the basins of attraction are found to be associated with higher-density environments.
Frontiers between adjacent basins of attractions are running through underdense regions.

Fig. 7.— Visualization of basins of attraction. The two surfaces enclosing the basins of attraction of Laniakea
and Arrowhead are shown as blue and yellow semi-transparent Gouraud-shaded polygons. Streamlines seeded
randomly within the Laniakea envelope are shown as black polylines. To provide more context, the V-web
is also represented with a grey surface for the filaments and a red surface for the knots. In terms of
cosmography, it is particularly interesting to examine the Arch filament that connects the Perseus-Pisces
knot to the Laniakea knot, crossing the Laniakea border at a normal incidence.
