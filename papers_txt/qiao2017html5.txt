           This study aimed to propose a pure web-based solution to serve users to access large-scale 3D medical volume anywhere with
           good user experience and complete details. A novel solution of the Master-Slave interaction mode was proposed, which absorbed
           advantages of remote volume rendering and surface rendering. On server side, we designed a message-responding mechanism to
           listen to interactive requests from clients (Slave model) and to guide Master volume rendering. On client side, we used HTML5 to
           normalize user-interactive behaviors on Slave model and enhance the accuracy of behavior request and user-friendly experience.
           The results showed that more than four independent tasks (each with a data size of 249.4 MB) could be simultaneously carried
           out with a 100-KBps client bandwidth (extreme test); the first loading time was <12 s, and the response time of each behavior
           request for final high quality image remained at approximately 1 s, while the peak value of bandwidth was <50-KBps. Meanwhile,
           the FPS value for each client was ≥40. This solution could serve the users by rapidly accessing the application via one URL hyperlink
           without special software and hardware requirement in a diversified network environment and could be easily integrated into other
           telemedical systems seamlessly.
