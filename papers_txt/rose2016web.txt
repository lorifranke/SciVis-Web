Figure 1: Multi-scale visualization of the ~2.5 M atoms HIV-1 capsid structure (PDB ID 3J3Q, [Zhao et al. 2013]) in the NGL Viewer after
loading from a ~13 MB gzipped MMTF file. Shown are visualizations with an increasing level of detail which are generated on-the-fly from
   the same file. The more detailed visualizations are only created for parts of the whole structure to reduce visual clutter and allow fast
 rendering. Left: molecular surface rendering of the whole capsid. Middle: secondary structure cartoon with a background silhouette of a
                            hexametric subunit. Right: atom and bond display of two helices shown as cylinders.
