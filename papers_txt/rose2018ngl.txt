Abstract
Motivation: The interactive visualization of very large macromolecular complexes on the web is
becoming a challenging problem as experimental techniques advance at an unprecedented rate
and deliver structures of increasing size.
Results: We have tackled this problem by developing highly memory-efficient and scalable exten-
sions for the NGL WebGL-based molecular viewer and by using Macromolecular Transmission
Format (MMTF), a binary and compressed MMTF. These enable NGL to download and render mo-
lecular complexes with millions of atoms interactively on desktop computers and smartphones
alike, making it a tool of choice for web-based molecular visualization in research and education.
Availability and implementation: The source code is freely available under the MIT license at
github.com/arose/ngl and distributed on NPM (npmjs.com/package/ngl). MMTF-JavaScript
encoders and decoders are available at github.com/rcsb/mmtf-javascript.
