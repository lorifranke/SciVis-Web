Abstract
Summary: Protael is a JavaScript library for creating interactive visualizations of biological
sequences and various associated data. It allows users to generate high-quality vector graphics
(SVG) and integrate it into web pages.
Availability and implementation: Protael distribution, documentation and examples are freely
available at http://protael.org; source code is hosted at https://github.com/sanshu/protaeljs.
