Abstract
Summary: Bio3D-web is an online application for analyzing the sequence, structure and conform-
ational heterogeneity of protein families. Major functionality is provided for identifying protein
structure sets for analysis, their alignment and refined structure superposition, sequence and
structure conservation analysis, mapping and clustering of conformations and the quantitative
comparison of their predicted structural dynamics.
Availability: Bio3D-web is based on the Bio3D and Shiny R packages. All major browsers are sup-
ported and full source code is available under a GPL2 license from http://thegrantlab.org/bio3d-
web.
