Life Sciences Reporting Summary
Nature Research wishes to improve the reproducibility of the work that we publish. This form is intended for publication with all accepted life
science papers and provides structure for consistency and transparency in reporting. Every life science submission will use this form; some list
items might not apply to an individual manuscript, but all fields must be completed for clarity.
For further information on the points included in this form, see Reporting Life Sciences Research. For further information on Nature Research
policies, including our data availability policy, see Authors & Referees and the Editorial Policy Checklist.


`   Experimental design
1. Sample size
    Describe how sample size was determined.                         n/a

2. Data exclusions
    Describe any data exclusions.                                    n/a
3. Replication
    Describe whether the experimental findings were                  n/a
    reliably reproduced.
4. Randomization
    Describe how samples/organisms/participants were                 n/a
    allocated into experimental groups.
5. Blinding
    Describe whether the investigators were blinded to               n/a
    group allocation during data collection and/or analysis.
    Note: all studies involving animals and/or human research participants must disclose whether blinding and randomization were used.

6. Statistical parameters
    For all figures and tables that use statistical methods, confirm that the following items are present in relevant figure legends (or in the
    Methods section if additional space is needed).

n/a Confirmed

          The exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement (animals, litters, cultures, etc.)
          A description of how samples were collected, noting whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same
          sample was measured repeatedly
          A statement indicating how many times each experiment was replicated
          The statistical test(s) used and whether they are one- or two-sided (note: only common tests should be described solely by name; more
          complex techniques should be described in the Methods section)
          A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as an adjustment for multiple comparisons
          The test results (e.g. P values) given as exact values whenever possible and with confidence intervals noted
          A clear description of statistics including central tendency (e.g. median, mean) and variation (e.g. standard deviation, interquartile range)
          Clearly defined error bars
                                                                                                                                                                   June 2017

7. Software
    Describe the software used to analyze the data in this            see code availability statement in the manuscript
    study.
    For manuscripts utilizing custom algorithms or software that are central to the paper but not yet described in the published literature, software must be made
    available to editors and reviewers upon request. We strongly encourage code deposition in a community repository (e.g. GitHub). Nature Methods guidance for
    providing algorithms and software for publication provides further information on this topic.

`   Materials and reagents
Policy information about availability of materials
8. Materials availability
    Indicate whether there are restrictions on availability of        n/a
    unique materials or if these materials are only available
    for distribution by a for-profit company.
9. Antibodies
    Describe the antibodies used and how they were validated n/a
    for use in the system under study (i.e. assay and species).
10. Eukaryotic cell lines
    a. State the source of each eukaryotic cell line used.            n/a
