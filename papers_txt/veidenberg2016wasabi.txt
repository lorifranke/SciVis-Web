          Abstract
          Wasabi is an open source, web-based environment for evolutionary sequence analysis. Wasabi visualizes sequence data
          together with a phylogenetic tree within a modern, user-friendly interface: The interface hides extraneous options,
          supports context sensitive menus, drag-and-drop editing, and displays additional information, such as ancestral se-
          quences, associated with specific tree nodes. The Wasabi environment supports reproducibility by automatically storing
          intermediate analysis steps and includes built-in functions to share data between users and publish analysis results. For
          computational analysis, Wasabi supports PRANK and PAGAN for phylogeny-aware alignment and alignment extension,
          and it can be easily extended with other tools. Along with drag-and-drop import of local files, Wasabi can access remote
          data through URL and import sequence data, GeneTrees and EPO alignments directly from Ensembl. To demonstrate a
          typical workflow using Wasabi, we reproduce key findings from recent comparative genomics studies, including a
          reanalysis of the EGLN1 gene from the tiger genome study: These case studies can be browsed within Wasabi at
          http://wasabiapp.org:8000?id=usecases. Wasabi runs inside a web browser and does not require any installation. One
          can start using it at http://wasabiapp.org. All source code is licensed under the AGPLv3.
          Key words: evolutionary sequence analysis, reproducible research, data visualization.

FIG. 1. Overview of Wasabi interface. The toolbar contains menus and buttons for data management, analysis tools, zoom levels, undo/redo, and server
notifications. Pop-up menus are associated with tree nodes and reveal ancestral sequences which are displayed in lighter colors next to the node. A
windowing system provides access to other functionality (e.g., sequence translation and analysis library, shown above).
