   practice. The work is using open source frameworks and
   libraries    such     as    WebRTC       (Web      Real-Time
   Communication), JSARToolKit (JavaScript Augmented
   Reality Toolkit), Three.js and NanoDICOM. The system
   builds a 3D model from the slices of a patient’s DICOM
   imagistic investigation files, superimposes the model on the
   body area of interest using Augmented Reality and sends
   the camera images remotely. The main advantage consists in
   real-time viewing of imagistic patient information by
   assisting physicians or medical students. Virtually attaching
   the 3D model to a specific area of the body allows the model
   to rotate and move in the same time with the patient. The
   proposed application does not depend on any operating
   system and runs inside a browser window without any
   closed source plug-in, allowing it to be accessed on any
   computer or mobile device that has a suitable browser.

 (ID) associated with it. This association allows us to have
 multiple markers tracked in the same time in the real-time
 video feed and gives us the possibility to attach different
 3D models to each one of them.
    The markers are very similar to QR codes. The major
 difference is that we don’t need to track QR codes across
 multiple frames. We interpret their pattern once in order to
 obtain usually a string of text.
     The markers are also used as a point of reference in
 order to establish the 3D model’s position and orientation
 in the visualized scene. This allows us to rotate or scale
 the 3D model associated with a specific marker attached
 to a real object when it changes its position.
    The ID markers usually have a black, square contour
