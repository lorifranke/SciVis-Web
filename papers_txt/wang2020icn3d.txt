Abstract
Motivation: Build a web-based 3D molecular structure viewer focusing on interactive structural
analysis.
Results: iCn3D (I-see-in-3D) can simultaneously show 3D structure, 2D molecular contacts and 1D
protein and nucleotide sequences through an integrated sequence/annotation browser. Pre-
defined and arbitrary molecular features can be selected in any of the 1D/2D/3D windows as sets of
residues and these selections are synchronized dynamically in all displays. Biological annotations
such as protein domains, single nucleotide variations, etc. can be shown as tracks in the 1D se-
quence/annotation browser. These customized displays can be shared with colleagues or publish-
ers via a simple URL. iCn3D can display structure–structure alignments obtained from NCBI’s
VASTþ service. It can also display the alignment of a sequence with a structure as identified by
BLAST, and thus relate 3D structure to a large fraction of all known proteins. iCn3D can also display
electron density maps or electron microscopy (EM) density maps, and export files for 3D printing.
The following example URL exemplifies some of the 1D/2D/3D representations: https://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/Structure/icn3d/full.html?mmdbid¼1TUP&showanno¼1&show2d¼1&showsets¼1.
Availability and implementation: iCn3D is freely available to the public. Its source code is available
at https://github.com/ncbi/icn3d.

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
