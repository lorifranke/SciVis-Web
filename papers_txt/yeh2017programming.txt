4 APPLICATIONS
As stated earlier, this VRMath2 environment was originally
designed as an educational tool for developing spatial ability.
Spatial ability is also mostly associated with geometry and
mathematics. However, over the past four years, it has been
identified that this VRMath2 environment can have applications
in areas other than mathematics education. More specifically, the
programming driven 3D modeling in VRMath2 can facilitate
learning in STEM education (Yeh and Chandra 2015).

5 DISCUSSIONS
The use of computer programming to generate 3D models or
virtual worlds is neither a new idea nor the best way to create
3D contents. However, in the case of VRMath2, the use of Logo
programming language to create 3D virtual worlds on the Web is
the first of its kind. Nevertheless, it has its strengths and
weaknesses in different contexts. The Logo programming
language adapted in the VRMath2 environment is still                  Figure 10: Sea surface animation simulation.

    The text-based programming paradigm of Logo (as well as

appealing to beginning programmers. However, the types and

6 CONCLUSION
This paper introduces the use of Logo programming to create 3D
virtual worlds online in the VRMath2 application. Using a
programming language to generate 3D contents can have high
precision for mathematical and scientific visualization and
simulation. The programming codes can be easily modified,
shared and reused to generate and handle large sets of data,
which can be used for purposes such as complex objects and
animations. The Logo programming in VRMath2 has a range of
3D movements (i.e., egocentric, fixed and universal) that are
