Implementing WebGL and HTML5 in Macromolecular Visualization
Traditional Ofﬂine Macromolecular Visualization Tools
Proteins are the most versatile macromolecules in living cells, and they have an essential role in
all biological processes. They function as catalysts, transporters, means for oxygen storage,
immune protectors, growth controllers, and signal transductors [1,2]. The biological and
pharmacological functions of all proteins are determined by their unique 3D structures [3–
6]. Thus, studying the structural properties of proteins is a centrally important question in both
biological and pharmaceutical research.

Rational drug design combines structural biology and computational biology approaches. It is
an inventive process of ﬁnding new drug molecules, based on understanding a biological target
or known compounds [4,7]. Currently, this process relies heavily on computer visualization and
modeling, also known as computer-aided drug design (CADD) (see Glossary) [8,9]. CADD

on WebGL and JavaScript. The scene can be zoomed and rotated directly in a Web browser
without additional plugins (Figure 1). Moreover, different molecular representations can be

export scene descriptions to various formats, including VRML-1, VRML-2, X3D, and X3DOM,
all of which can be embedded into a Web browser by WebGL and HTML5. In UCSF Chimera,
the 3D scene can be exported as a HTML5 ﬁle directly through the ‘export’ menu. Moreover, it
can also export to other 3D objects, such as COLLADA [.dae], VRML [.wrl, .vrml], and X3D.

Macromolecular Visualization under WebGL and HTML5
Besides the ofﬂine tools and their WebGL derivatives, many dedicated online tools (Table 1)
have implemented both WebGL and HTML5 to facilitate the visualization of a macromolecule
through Web browsers (Figure 2, Key Figure) [340_TD$IF][24,25].

As an example, the NGL Viewer [341_TD$IF][24] can interactively display large molecular complexes
(Figure 3) and is also unaffected by the retirement of third-party plugins, such as Flash and
Java Applets [341_TD$IF][24]. Generally, this Web application offers comprehensive molecular visualization
through a graphic interface so that life scientists can easily access and beneﬁt from available
structural data in various ways: showing the bond orders of a small molecule, displaying
electrostatic maps, showing X-ray electron density maps, displaying protein–ligand interac-
tions, showing a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation water box, playing movies based on a MD
simulation trajectory (Movie 1, an MD simulation trajectory played in NGL Viewer), and many
others (Figure 3). NGL Viewer supports common structural ﬁle formats, such as pdb, mol2, and
gro. Users can also generate different molecular representations, such as cartoons, ball-and-
sticks, surfaces, and meshes with NGL Viewer. In addition, several useful analysis functions
including distance measurement and residue labeling, and so on, have been implemented in
NGL. Furthermore, the viewer can be easily integrated into other Websites, providing profes-
sional visualizations of structural entries [341_TD$IF][24].

Another impressive WebGL application is the iView tool [21]. Besides showing structures in
various styles, iView is unique in exploiting hardware acceleration rather than software




                                                                                                            Trends in Biotechnology, Month Year, Vol. xx, No. yy   3

 Box 1. File and Visualization Formats Involved in WebGL
 Cascading Style Sheets (CSS): a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a
 markup language [327_TD$IF][17,51].


 DAE: an interchange ﬁle format for interactive 3D applications [328_TD$IF][52].


 Extensible Markup Language (XML): a markup language that deﬁnes a set of rules for encoding documents in a
 format that is both human readable and machine readable [329_TD$IF][57].


 GRO: Gromacs molecular coordinate ﬁle format (www.gromacs.org).


 HyperText Markup Language (HTML): the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
 With CSS and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web (www.w3.org/wiki/).


 JS: the ﬁle format for JavaScript, a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language [30_TD$IF][53].


 MOL2: Sybyl chemical modeler input ﬁle [31_TD$IF][54].


 Protein Data Bank (PDB): the PDB format provides a standard representation for macromolecular structure data
 derived from X-ray diffraction and NMR studies (www.rcsb.org).


 SDF: text-based chemical ﬁle formats that describe molecules and chemical reactions. One format, for example, lists
 each atom in a molecule, the x-y-z coordinates of that atom, and the bonds among the atoms [31_TD$IF][54].


 TCL: a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language.


 TK: an extension for the Tcl scripting language.


 TRJ: Gromacs MD simulation trajectory ﬁle format.


 Virtual Reality Markup Language (VRML): a standard ﬁle format for representing 3D interactive vector graphics,
 designed particularly with the World Wide Web in mind [32_TD$IF][55].


 X3D: a royalty-free ISO standard XML-based ﬁle format for representing 3D computer graphics. It is the successor to
 VRML [3_TD$IF][56].



rendering. It features three special stereo effects (anaglyph, parallax barrier, and oculus rift),
resulting in visually appealing identiﬁcation of intermolecular interactions [21]. Anaglyph 3D
refers to achieving a stereoscopic 3D effect by encoding the image of each eye, using ﬁlters of
different colors (typically red and cyan) [342_TD$IF][26]. Anaglyph 3D images contain two differently ﬁltered
colored images, one for each eye. When viewed through the anaglyph glasses, each of the two
images reaches the eye for which it is intended, revealing an integrated stereoscopic image
[342_TD$IF][26]. By contrast, instead of using 3D glasses, a parallax barrier is a device placed in front of any
           2D image source, such as a liquid crystal display (LCD), to allow it to show a stereoscopic or
           multiscopic image [34_TD$IF][27] directly. By comparison, the Oculus Rift is a virtual-reality (VR) headset
developed and manufactured by Oculus VR [34_TD$IF][28]. This unique and useful feature enables users
           to view a more vivid chemical stereo environment for online drug design in situ. Creative ideas
           for lead optimization can be investigated by these stereo effects. More recently, with advances
           in WebGL and VR technology, Autodesk Inc. created Autodesk Molecule Viewer to explore the
           protein world in VR. This application can visualize a protein structure in stereo with a mobile
           phone Web browser, where the user changes their head orientation to control the movements
           of a molecule.

Macromolecular Analysis under WebGL and HTML5
Besides focusing on visualizing the structural information alone, an increasing number of tools
have been developed for structural analysis (Table 1) [345_TD$IF][21,29–35]. For instance, molecular
recognition, the process of biological macromolecules interacting with each other or with
various small molecules, constitutes the basis of all processes in living organisms [37].
Therefore, depicting the protein–ligand interactions is essential to understanding biological
events at the atomic level [346_TD$IF][36]. The Protein–Ligand Interaction Proﬁler (PLIP) [347_TD$IF][30] is a WebGL-
based tool that uses cloud computing [348_TD$IF][37] to analyze noncovalent interactions in protein–
ligand complexes. PLIP enables users to retrieve structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB)
or submit a local PDB ﬁle without further preparation of the structure [347_TD$IF][30]. After analyzing the
complex in the backend server, the results page lists all detected noncovalent interactions,
including hydrogen bonds, water bridges, salt bridges, p-stacking, p–cation interactions,

halogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and metal complexes. As a result of WebGL and
HTML5 technology, without any plugins, the 3D protein–ligand interaction diagrams can be

text and machine-readable XML format. An ofﬂine PyMOL session ﬁle (pse) is also generated by
the backend calculation for downloading.

Another example is the Bio3D-Web APP (Table 1). Bio3D-Web is an online WebGL application,
built on top of the Bio3D package [349_TD$IF][29], for the user-friendly investigation of protein structure
ensembles (Figure 4B). Bio3D-Web provides a rapid and rigorous tool for the identiﬁcation and

comparative analysis of protein structures for a user-deﬁned protein family. Methods in Bio3D-
Web include a range of conventional sequences and structure conservation assessment
methods, as well as interconformer characterization with ensemble normal mode analysis
(eNMA) and principal component analysis (PCA), for comparison of predicted ﬂexibilities and
major structural displacements. The eNMA module in Bio3D-Web provides a conventional
single protein structure normal mode analysis. Options in Bio3D-Web cover a range of popular
elastic network models (ENMs), as well as enhanced analyses, including protein amino acid
side-chain ﬂuctuations, protein intrinsic ﬂexibility visualization, residue dynamic cross-correla-
tions, and so on (Figure 4B). Bio3D-Web has some prominent advantages compared with the
ofﬂine Bio3D package. First, with the ofﬂine package, users need to install the package locally,
which can be time-consuming to resolve library-dependency issues. Second, unlike the ofﬂine
version, which requires manually inputting various complicated command lines for analysis, the
Bio3D-Web is so user-friendly that all jobs can be easily completed by clicking buttons. Finally,
the results can be visualized online interactively without the installation of any plugins.

Many other useful tools have been developed, including the Autodesk Molecule Viewer,
GPCRdb, Speck ChemDoodle, and so on. These tools are summarized in Table 1.

Implementing WebGL and HTML5 in Modern CADD
          Modern CADD
          The process of modern drug discovery covers: target discovery; active compound discovery
          and screening; lead optimization (ADMET) [350_TD$IF][38] study; development; and registration. It is
          expensive both in time and monetary costs (Box 2) [4]. Bringing a drug to market now takes at
          least 10 years and costs US$2 billion on average [351_TD$IF][39–41]. CADD is an efﬁcient technology that
          can accelerate the drug discovery and development process. Compared with traditional
          biological and chemical methods, computational drug discovery also reduces costs noticeably
          [352_TD$IF][42]. As an example, it costs US$1 million–10 million plus 1–2 months to investigate 10–100
000 compounds for each target, using traditional high-throughput screening (HTS) robots
[35_TD$IF][43,44]. By contrast, performing virtual screening against several million diverse compound
          libraries in a workstation only consumes electricity and takes a few days to a few weeks [354_TD$IF][45,46].

Computational drug discovery is so useful that almost all pharmaceutical companies have
introduced this technology in their drug discovery and development pipeline [35_TD$IF][47]. In April 2015,
Sanoﬁ invested US$120 million in Schrödinger, a leading computational biology company, to
guide ten drug discovery programs with computational drug design technology. In June 2016,
another three pharmaceutical giants (Pﬁzer, GSK, and AbbVie) joined a US$51.5 million
collaboration on computational drug discovery at Morphic Therapeutic. More recently, the
Third Rock Ventures and D.E. Shaw Research announced the formation of Relay Therapeutics
with US$57 million Series A ﬁnancing, to integrate the mobility information of proteins through
all-atom, long timescale, MD simulations into drug discovery.

WebGL and HTML5 in Modern CADD
Although the traditional ofﬂine CADD tools contribute greatly to modern drug discovery, as with
many other technologies, they also have some limitations. For instance, some CADD software


                                                                                                              Trends in Biotechnology, Month Year, Vol. xx, No. yy   9

 Box 2. CADD in the Pipeline of Modern Drug Discovery
 Figure I depicts a typical drug discovery pipeline. In the upstream stage, bioinformatics, system biology, and reverse-
 docking methods can be applied for target identiﬁcation; once a target is validated, in silico methods, such as homology
 modeling or de novo structure building, can be developed to predict its 3D structure before experimental determination;
 CADD methods can also be used to predict target druggability. With virtual screening or de novo computational
 methods, potential lead compounds can be identiﬁed. In the downstream stage, lead optimization can be performed by
 some advanced CADD technologies, such as scaffold hopping, in situ design, or free energy calculation. Moreover, in
 silico ADMET prediction and physiologically based pharmacokinetic simulations can also be conducted to model the
 preclinical test, to reduce costs.

applications only support a speciﬁc platform or OS that is sometimes not widely used; some
CADD software is difﬁcult to install because of its dependency on many other libraries or
plugins; some of them only support a quad-buffered hardware-driven stereo mode, which
requires the support of an expensive and professional GPU; some of them only work in a local
machine; and, most importantly, many CADD applications have difﬁculties in sharing data in
real-time.

By contrast, WebGL- and HTML5-based computational tools overcome most of these issues.
As a cross-platform tool, when jobs are submitted through a Web browser, various computing
tasks are distributed to different software in the backend server (Box 3). As soon as the jobs are
done, all data can be analyzed and shared in a WebGL-based visualizer, which beneﬁts from
GPU acceleration [20]. Based on a speciﬁc JavaScript, WebGL visualizers can present 2D and/
or 3D graphics or even animations for chemical structures in a Web browser smoothly. Various
stereo effects can also be achieved with an elementary GPU instead of a dedicated one [21].
Furthermore, all of the resulting data can be shared by various users in any location in real-time.
As a result of these advantages, many WebGL-based CADD platforms and tools have been
developed (Table 1). Users can submit their jobs through any compatible Web browser, and the
jobs are then delivered to a server for cloud computing (Box 3). As soon as the jobs are
completed, users can retrieve and visualize the results in a Web browser. Post-job analysis,
ﬁgure rendering and movie making can also be done in a Web browser.

As an example, the Autodesk Bionano Molecular Design Toolkit (ABMDT) is an integrated
molecular simulation platform. ABMDT can perform online molecular visualization and cloud

 Box 3. The Development of WebGL and WebGL-Based CADD Platforms
 The ﬁrst Web3D application can be traced back to 1994 (Figure I) when the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML)
 was created as a standard ﬁle format for representing 3D interactive vector graphics within the World Wide Web. In
 1997, a new version of the format was ﬁnalized, as VRML97, and became an ISO standard [32_TD$IF][55]. In 2004, with the
 development of XML technology, the successor of VRML97 evolved into X3D [3_TD$IF][56]. In 2007, Web2.0 was developed for
 the World Wide Web, and allowed users to interact and collaborate with each other in a virtual community [34_TD$IF][58,59]. In
 2011, the WebGL 1.0 was developed. WebGL is integrated completely into all of the Web standards of the browser,
 allowing GPU-accelerated usage of image processing and graphic effects as part of the Web page canvas [19]. In 2017,
 the second generation of WebGL, called WebGL 2.0, was released. Real-time rendering and VR supports feature in
 WebGL 2.0. Currently, WebGL 2.0 is supported by the latest versions of the Firefox, Google Chrome, and Edge
 browsers.

Furthermore, Cyrus Bench is Rosetta’s [358_TD$IF][50] (commercial) molecular modeling and design
toolkit, mainly used for cloud computing with Rosetta packages for protein design. Besides
the above well-integrated platform/toolkit, a user can also develop a notebook style cloud
computing system at their own will, by incorporating Python Web server, JavaScript for
molecular visualization, and computational packages on the server.

Finally, MD simulations have an important role in CADD. The latest version of AmberTools16
combines Pytraj and NGLView tools, facilitating real-time MD simulations and trajectory
analysis through a Web browser. These tools have been integrated into the Jupyter notebooki[35_TD$IF],
a Web application that allows users to create and share documents that contain live code,
equations, visualizations, and explanatory text. The Jupyter notebook can perform various
tasks, including data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling,
machine learning, and so on. As a result of the integration of the NGLView tool, 3D structural
visualizations and trajectory-based movie making can be easily performed in the Jupyter
notebook.

Concluding Remarks
With the tremendous advances in both hardware and software developments in recent years,
computational biology has an increasingly important role in modern drug discovery. Many
leading pharmaceutical companies have invested huge amounts of money in the infrastructure
of CADD. Although traditional ofﬂine computational tools contribute greatly to this process, their
inherent weaknesses mean that they can no longer fulﬁll the needs of modern CADD. WebGL-
and HTML5-based CADD tools overcome most of the deﬁciencies of the traditional tools,
inspiring new customized options for CADD designers (see Outstanding Questions). Plugin-
free, online stereo visualization with potential VR supports, interactive design, cloud computing,
and real-time data sharing all feature in WebGL/HTML5-based next-generation CADD.
